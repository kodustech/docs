### Run the Installation Script

<Tip>
  Looking for more control? Check out our [docker-compose
  file](https://github.com/kodustech/kodus-installer/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
  for manual deployment options.
</Tip>

Set the proper permissions for the installation script:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
```

Run the script:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

### What the Installer Does

Our installer automates several important steps:

- Verifies Docker installation
- Creates networks for Kodus services
- Clones repositories and configures environment files
- Runs docker-compose to start all services
- Executes database migrations
- Seeds initial data

ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** When complete, Kodus Orchestrator API and Web Application should be running on your machine.

You can verify your installation by visiting `http://localhost:3000` - you should see the Kodus Web Application interface.

<Warning>
  Code Review features will not work yet unless you complete the reverse proxy
  setup. Without this configuration, external Git providers cannot send webhooks
  to your instance.
