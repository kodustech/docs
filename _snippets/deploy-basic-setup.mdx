<Note>
  **Internet access is only required if you plan to connect with cloud-based Git
  services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.** For self-hosted Git tools within
  your network, external internet access is optional.
</Note>

## Domain Name Setup (Optional)

If you're planning to integrate Kodus with cloud-based Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), you'll need public-facing URLs for both the Kodus Web App and its API. This allows your server to receive webhooks for proper Code Review functionality and ensures correct application behavior.

We recommend setting up two subdomains:
- One for the Web Application, e.g., `kodus-web.yourdomain.com`.
- One for the API, e.g., `kodus-api.yourdomain.com`.

Both subdomains should have DNS A records pointing to your server's IP address. Later in this guide, we will configure a reverse proxy (Nginx) to route requests to these subdomains to the correct internal services. This setup is essential for full functionality, including webhooks and authentication.

> **Note**: If you're only connecting to self-hosted Git tools on your network and do not require public access or webhooks, you might be able to use a simpler setup, but this guide focuses on public-facing deployments.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the installer repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kodustech/kodus-installer.git
    cd kodus-installer
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the example environment file">
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate secure keys for the required environment variables">
    ```bash
    ./generate-keys.sh
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the environment file">
    Edit `.env` with your values using your preferred text editor. 
    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

    See [Environment Variables Configuration](/how_to_deploy/en/deploy_kodus/generic_vm#environment-variables-configuration) for detailed instructions.  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the installer">
    ```bash
    ./scripts/install.sh
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Success 🎉">
  When complete, Kodus Services should be running on your machine.
  You can verify your installation using the following script:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/doctor.sh
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access the web interface">
    Once you access the web interface for the first time, you'll need to:

1. **Create your admin account** - This will be the first user with full system access
2. **Configure your Git provider** - Connect GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket following the on-screen instructions
3. **Select repositories** for analysis - Choose which code repositories Kody will review
