## Kody Code Review Not Working? Steps to Fix Common Issues

### Token Issues

If you're connected via a token, ensure these points are checked:

- **GitHub Users**: Verify that your token is enabled for your organization:
  1. You must be the organization owner.
  2. Go to your organization's settings in GitHub:
     - Use the following URL and replace `YOUR_ORG_NAME` with the name of your organization:
       <small>
         `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG_NAME/settings/member_privileges`
       </small>
       .
  3. Under **Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens**, ensure **"Allow access via fine-grained personal access tokens"** is selected.
- **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Confirm that your token is configured for your organization and has the required permissions. [Manage tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
- **Token Expiry**: Make sure your token is active. [Check token status](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).

### Configuration Issues

- **Automated Reviews**: Ensure automated reviews are enabled in your [Global Settings](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general). If disabled, start reviews manually with `@kody start-review`.
- **Review Types**: Ensure at least one review type is selected for Kody to provide suggestions. [Configure review types](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general).
- **Branch Reviews**: By default, Kody reviews PRs merged into the default branch. To include additional branches, [update your configuration](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general).
- **Large PRs**: Be aware that PRs with a high number of changes may take longer to process.

### Global vs. Repository Settings

Kody uses a hierarchical configuration system. Here's how it works:

- **Global Settings**: Applied to all repositories by default.
- **Repository-Specific Settings**: If configured, they will override global settings for that specific repository.

#### Steps to Troubleshoot

1. **Check Global Configuration**: Review and confirm global settings are correct. [Access Global Settings](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general).
2. **Verify Repository Settings**:
   - Navigate to the **By Repositories** section in your settings.
   - Confirm if custom configurations are set for the repository in question.
3. **Align or Clear Configurations**:
   - To apply global settings, clear any repository-specific configurations.
   - Alternatively, adjust the repository-specific settings to meet your needs.

#### Common Symptoms

- Automated reviews are not triggered for a repository.
- Kody applies unexpected settings or suggestions.
- Global settings are not reflected in specific repositories.
