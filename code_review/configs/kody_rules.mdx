Kody Rules are customizable guidelines your team sets up to automatically enforce code quality, consistency, security, and maintainability.

## How to use Kody Rules

You can use Kody Rules in two ways:

### Create Custom Rules

Define rules based on your team's exact needs:

- Rule name: Clearly define the rule purpose.
- File Paths: Limit rules to specific files or directories using glob patterns.
- Severity: Set to Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
- Detailed Instructions: Clearly state what's expected and why.

**Example:**

- Rule: "Avoid equality operators (==, !=) in loop termination conditions."
- Path: src/\*_/_.ts
- Severity: Critical
- Instructions: "Using equality operators (== or !=) can cause infinite loops if exact values aren't matched.

### Import from Rules Library

Leverage proven best practices instantly:

- Navigate to Discovery Rules in your Kodus dashboard.
- Filter rules by severity, language, or tags.
- Import and activate rules with a single click.

**Examples:**

- Security: "Disallow use of insecure MD5 hashing."
- Maintainability: "Limit React components to less than 150 lines."
