## Variations of Lead Time
<Note>All Lead Time calculations take into account the item [type configuration](parameters) for accurate metric computation.</Note>

### Lead Time

Overall Lead Time tracks the duration from the **TODO** stage to any **DONE** stage across all board items, capturing the full cycle of task completion.

**Data structure:**
```
{
    "total": "number",
    "percentiles": {
        "p50": "number",
        "p75": "number", 
        "p95": "number",
    } 
}
```

#### Lead Time By Item Type

Dive deeper with Lead Time analysis per item type, offering detailed insights into process efficiency.
**Data structure:**
```
      "ItemType":{
         "average" "number",
         "percentiles":{
            "p50": "number",
            "p75": "number",
            "p95": "number"
         }
      }...
```


### Lead Time In WIP

Focuses on the active phase of task progression, measuring from the initial WIP stage to completion, for a clear view of ongoing work efficiency.
**Data structure:**
```
{
    "total": "number",
    "percentiles": {
        "p50": "number",
        "p75": "number", 
        "p95": "number",
    } 
}
```
#### Lead Time In WIP by Item Type
Analyze the active development phase by item type for targeted process improvements.

**Data structure:**
```{
      "ItemType":{
         "average" "number",
         "percentiles":{
            "p50": "number",
            "p75": "number",
            "p95": "number"
         }
      }...
```

### Lead Time By Column 
**Retrieve data from:** Project Management Tool\
Identify workflow bottlenecks with a breakdown of average time spent in each board column.\
**Data structure:**
```
{"Column": "number", "Column": "number"...}
```
