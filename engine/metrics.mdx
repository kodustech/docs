<Note>All Lead Time calculations take into account the item type configuration for accurate metric computation.</Note>

### Lead Time

The Overall Lead Time quantifies the time required for an item to move from the start, in the **TODO** column, to completion in any **DONE** column on the work board. 
This metric includes all items on the mapped board, covering both items in progress and those completed.

**Return structure:**
```
{
    "total": "number",
    "percentiles": {
        "p50": "number",
        "p75": "number", 
        "p95": "number",
    } 
}
```

#### Lead Time By Item Type

This variation of Lead Time breaks down the average processing time based on the different item types on your work board, allowing for more granular analysis.

**Return structure:**
```
      "ItemType":{
         "average" "number",
         "percentiles":{
            "p50": "number",
            "p75": "number",
            "p95": "number"
         }
      }...
```


### Lead Time In WIP

The Lead Time in WIP focuses exclusively on the period items are actively being worked on, starting the count when an item is moved to the first WIP (Work In Progress) column set up in the configuration. 
This metric considers both items currently in WIP and those already completed.
**Return structure:**
```
{
    "total": "number",
    "percentiles": {
        "p50": "number",
        "p75": "number", 
        "p95": "number",
    } 
}
```
#### Lead Time In WIP by Item Type
This variation of Lead Time In WIP breaks down the average processing time based on the different item types on your work board, allowing for more granular analysis.

**Return structure:**
```{
      "ItemType":{
         "average" "number",
         "percentiles":{
            "p50": "number",
            "p75": "number",
            "p95": "number"
         }
      }...
```

### Lead Time By Column 
**Retrieve data from:** Project Management Tool

This variation of Lead Time provides a breakdown of the average time items spend in each column of the board, offering insights into potential bottlenecks in the workflow.

**Return structure:**
```
{"Column": "number", "Column": "number"...}
```

## Bug Ratio
