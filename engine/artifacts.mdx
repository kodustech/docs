        ## Lack of waiting columns
       
        ## Work Items skipping WIP columns
        **Issue:** Work items are bypassing 'In Progress' (WIP) stages, moving directly to 'Done'.\
        **Impact:** Skipping WIP columns undermines the accuracy of metrics and projections, essential for data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement.
        ## Team respecting WIP limit
        Time está respeitando ou não limite de WIP. O limite de WIP padrão dentro da plataforma é $(numberOfTasksInWIP > 2 * teamSize)$\
        **Why you should care:** Colunas de espera ajudam a entender melhor os gaps do fluxo do board do time.
        ## Work Items description quality
        **Issue:** Adherence to the Work In Progress (WIP) limit, defined as $(numberOfTasksInWIP > 2 * teamSize)$.\
        **Impact:** Maintaining WIP limits ensures a balanced workflow, preventing task overload and promoting efficient, timely deliveries.
        ## High Lead Time in Waiting Columns
        **Issue:** The clarity and comprehensiveness of work item descriptions are evaluated.\
        **Impact:** Clear descriptions facilitate seamless collaboration and faster development, significantly impacting delivery quality and speed.
        ## High Bug Ratio
        **Issue:** The ratio of bugs to total work items is assessed.\
        **Impact:** A high bug ratio signals possible quality issues in outputs and workflows, necessitating reviews and improvements in testing and development practices.
        ## Work Items with assigned owner
        **Issue:** Evaluation of whether work items in progress have designated owners.\
        **Impact:** Assigning owners to tasks enhances accountability, facilitates communication, and ensures continuous progress towards completion.
        ## Work Items stopping in waiting columns
        **Issue:** Identification of items stalled in waiting columns for over 48 hours.\
        **Impact:** Prolonged inactivity indicates potential project stalls or dependencies, requiring urgent attention to maintain flow and meet deadlines.
        ## New bugs
        **Issue:** Tracking of new bugs reported within the last 24 hours.\
        **Impact:** An uptick in bugs may highlight the need for quality reassessment, impacting resource allocation towards innovation and affecting customer value perception.
