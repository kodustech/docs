## Work Items
Work Items encompass all the elements your team manages within product management software, such as Tasks, Bugs, and Technical Debt. 
These items represent the individual units of work that are tracked, managed, and completed by team members to achieve project goals and address issues.


## Metrics
At the heart of Kody's intelligence lie engineering and process metrics, the pillars that support the generation of Artifacts, Projections, and Insights for teams. We adhere to a "less is more" philosophy, concentrating on essential metrics that every team needs to monitor:
* Delivery Velocity
* Delivery Quality
* Team Efficiency

## Team Artifacts
Team Artifacts are generated from the continuous monitoring and analysis of development activities and project management. Designed to provide actionable insights and alert teams about specific issues, such as exceeded WIP (Work In Progress) limits or vague task descriptions, artifacts also celebrate significant team achievements. Key artifacts include:
* **Issue Alerts:** Notifications triggered by critical thresholds or conditions, such as exceeding WIP limits or high bug rates.
* **Performance Reports:** Comprehensive analyses of team performance, highlighting efficiency, productivity, and quality, pinpointing areas for improvement.
* **Efficiency Analyses:** Evaluations of the current workflow efficiency, identifying bottlenecks and recommending optimizations.
* **Success Acknowledgments:** Highlights of notable team achievements, such as successful completion of key milestones or overcoming substantial challenges.
* **Historical and Comparative Data:** Performance comparisons with historical data to spot trends, advancements, or setbacks in team performance.
