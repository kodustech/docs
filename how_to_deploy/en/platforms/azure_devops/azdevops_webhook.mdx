Kody usually creates the webhook automatically. If that didn't happen, follow these steps to set it up manually:

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project.
2. Click on "Project settings" in the bottom-left corner.
3. Under the "General" section, select "Service hooks".
4. Click the "+ Create Subscription" button.
5. Time to configure your webhook:

   - **Service**: Choose **"Web Hooks"**
   - **Trigger on this type of event**: Select the event type (see below)
   - **URL**: Enter the URL where you want to receive notifications â€” the same one set in `GLOBAL_AZURE_CODE_MANAGEMENT_WEBHOOK` in your `.env` file.
   - **Details**:
     - **Pull request created**
     - **Pull request updated**
     - **Pull request commented**
   - **Filters** (optional): You can filter by repository or branch if needed.
   - **Action**: Configure to send a POST request to the given URL.

6. Click "Finish"

And that's it! You've successfully set up a webhook to enable Kody to review your pull requests in Azure DevOps.

<Note>
  Make sure the URL you use is reachable and accepts incoming POST requests for
  pull request events.
