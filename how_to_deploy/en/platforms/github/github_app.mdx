title: Creating a GitHub App

If you want to run Kody with a github app, you need to create a GitHub App. This app enables Kody to interact with your repositories, manage pull requests, and receive webhooks.

<Note>If you want to enable "Sign in with GitHub" for platform users, that's a separate OAuth App process and doesn't interfere with the GitHub App permissions. 
This guide focuses on the functional integration.</Note>

## Prerequisites

Have your application domains ready:

- **WEB_DOMAIN**: Your Frontend URL (e.g., `https://app.yourdomain.com` or `http://localhost:3000`)
- **API_DOMAIN**: Your Backend/API URL (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com` or `http://localhost:3000` for monorepo/proxy setups)

## Step 1: Create the GitHub App

1. On GitHub, go to **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **GitHub Apps**
2. Click **New GitHub App**
3. Fill in the basic information (Name, Homepage URL) according to your preference

## Step 2: Configure Callback and Setup URLs

This step is critical to ensure installation and redirection work properly. Fill in the fields below, replacing `WEB_DOMAIN` with your actual URL:

- **Callback URL**:
  ```
  WEB_DOMAIN/api/auth/callback/github
  ```
  This URL is used to complete the authorization flow.

- **Setup URL**:
  ```
  WEB_DOMAIN/setup/github
  ```

- Check the option: **Redirect on update**
  This ensures that after installing the app, users are redirected back to Kodus to complete the setup.

## Step 3: Configure the Webhook

The webhook notifies Kodus about events in your pull requests.

- **Webhook URL**:
  ```
  API_DOMAIN/github/webhook
  ```

- Make sure the **Active** option is checked

## Step 4: Collect Credentials and Add to .env

Now you need to get the credentials generated by GitHub and add them to your Kodus environment variables.

### App ID

At the top of your app's "About" page, copy the **App ID**.

Add to your `.env`:
```
API_GITHUB_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
```

### Client Secret

Go to the **Client secrets** section and click **Generate a new client secret**.

Copy the generated value.

Add to your `.env`:
```
API_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

### Private Key

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Generate a private key**.

This will download a `.pem` file. Open this file with a text editor and copy the entire content.

Add to your `.env`:
```
API_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ..."
```

## Summary of Environment Variables

At the end, your configuration file should contain:

```bash
API_GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
API_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=example_secret_123
API_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ..."
```

Click **Save Changes** on GitHub and restart your Kodus application to apply the changes.
