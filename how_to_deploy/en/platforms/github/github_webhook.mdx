Kodus usually creates the webhook automatically. If that didn't happen, follow these steps to set it up manually:

1. Head over to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Find "Webhooks" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Add webhook"
5. Configure your webhook:

   - **Payload URL**: Enter the URL from your `.env` file: `API_GITHUB_CODE_MANAGEMENT_WEBHOOK`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: Leave blank
   - **SSL verification**: Enable SSL verification
   - **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**: Let me select individual events
   - Check these boxes:
     - Issue comment
     - Pull request review comments
     - Pull request review threads
     - Pull request reviews
     - Pull requests
     - Pushes

6. Click "Add webhook"

You've successfully set up a webhook for code reviews in your GitHub repository.
