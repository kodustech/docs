2. Go to "Settings" > "Webhooks"
3. Configure your webhook:

   - **URL**: Enter the URL from your `.env` file: `API_GITLAB_CODE_MANAGEMENT_WEBHOOK`
   - **Check Show full URL**
   - **Name**: (optional) Kodus Code Review
   - **Description**: (optional) Kodus Code Review Webhook
   - **Secret token**: Leave blank
   - **SSL verification**: Enable SSL verification
   - **Trigger**: Select the following events:
     - Comments
     - Issue events
     - Merge request events

4. Click "Add webhook"

You've successfully set up a webhook for code reviews in your GitLab repository.
