Kodus usually creates the webhook automatically. If that didn't happen, follow these steps to set it up manually:

1. Navigate to your GitLab project
2. Go to "Settings" > "Webhooks"
3. Time to configure your webhook:

   - **URL**: Drop in the URL where you want to receive notifications, the URL you put under `API_GITLAB_CODE_MANAGEMENT_WEBHOOK` in the `.env` file
   - **Check Show full URL**
   - **Name**: (optional) Kodus Code Review
   - **Description**: (optional) Kodus Code Review Webhook
   - **Secret token**: Leave blank
   - **SSL verification**: Enable SSL verification
   - **Trigger**: Select the following events:
     - Comments
     - Issue events
     - Merge request events

4. Click "Add webhook"

And that's it! You've successfully set up a webhook to do code reviews in your GitLab repository.
