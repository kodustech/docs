Kodus usually creates the webhook automatically. If that didn't happen, follow these steps to set it up manually:

1. Navigate to your Bitbucket repository
2. Click on "Repository settings" in the left sidebar
3. Select "Webhooks"
4. Click "Add webhook"
5. Time to configure your webhook:

   - **Title**: Kodus Code Review
   - **URL**: Drop in the URL where you want to receive notifications, the URL you put under `GLOBAL_BITBUCKET_CODE_MANAGEMENT_WEBHOOK` in the `.env` file
   - **Status**: Active
   - **SSL/TLS**: Check Enable SSL verification
   - **Triggers**: Select these events:
        - Repository:
            - Push
            - Updated
            - Commit comment created
            - Build status created
            - Build status updated
        - Issue
            - Created
            - Updated
            - Comment created
        - Pull Request
            - Created
            - Updated
            - Merged
            - Declined
            - Comment created
            - Comment deleted
            - Comment updated
            - Comment resolved
            - Comment reopened

6. Click "Save"

And that's it! You've successfully set up a webhook to do code reviews in your Bitbucket repository.
