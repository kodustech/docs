## Quick Fixes

### "Run diagnostics"

The installer ships with a doctor script that checks the stack and common misconfigurations.

```bash
cd kodus-installer
./scripts/doctor.sh
```

### "I can't access the web interface"

1. Check if the containers are running:

```bash
docker-compose ps kodus-web
```

2. Verify the ports are correctly mapped:

```bash
docker-compose port kodus-web 3000
```

3. Check the web container logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs kodus-web
```

### "Git webhooks aren't working"

1. Verify your domain setup:

```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```

2. Check the webhooks logs for webhook attempts:

```bash
docker-compose logs webhooks | grep webhook
```

3. Verify your reverse proxy configuration:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

### "Database connection issues"

1. Check database container status:

```bash
docker-compose ps db_kodus_postgres
docker-compose ps db_kodus_mongodb
```

2. Verify database logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs db_kodus_postgres
docker-compose logs db_kodus_mongodb
```

3. Test database connections:

```bash
docker-compose exec db_kodus_postgres psql -U $API_PG_DB_USERNAME -d $API_PG_DB_DATABASE
docker-compose exec db_kodus_mongodb mongosh -u $API_MG_DB_USERNAME -p $API_MG_DB_PASSWORD
```

### "Migration failed due to missing vector type"

If you encounter the error "type vector does not exist" during migrations, this is because the pgvector extension is not enabled in your PostgreSQL database. Here's how to fix it:

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
docker-compose exec db_kodus_postgres psql -U $API_PG_DB_USERNAME -d $API_PG_DB_DATABASE
```

2. Enable the pgvector extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

3. After enabling the extension, try running your migrations again:

```bash
docker-compose exec api npm run migration:run
```

If you're still experiencing issues, you can verify the extension is properly installed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';
```

## Common Problems

### RabbitMQ Issues

If you're seeing message queue errors:

1. Check RabbitMQ status:

```bash
docker-compose logs rabbitmq
```

2. Access the management console at `http://localhost:15672` to verify queues and connections

3. Restart the service if needed:

```bash
docker-compose restart rabbitmq
```

### Resource Problems

If services are slow or crashing:

1. Check resource usage:

```bash
docker stats
```

2. Verify container limits:

```bash
docker inspect $(docker-compose ps -q api) | grep -A 5 "Resources"
```

3. Adjust resource limits in docker-compose.yml if needed
