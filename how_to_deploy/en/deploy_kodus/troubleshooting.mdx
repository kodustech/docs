## Quick Fixes

### "I can't access the web interface"

1. Check if the containers are running:

```bash
docker ps | grep kodus-web-prod
```

2. Verify the ports are correctly mapped:

```bash
docker port kodus-web-prod
```

3. Check the web container logs:

```bash
docker logs kodus-web-prod
```

### "Git webhooks aren't working"

1. Verify your domain setup:

```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```

2. Check the orchestrator logs for webhook attempts:

```bash
docker logs kodus-orchestrator-prod | grep webhook
```

3. Verify your reverse proxy configuration:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

### "Database connection issues"

1. Check database container status:

```bash
docker ps | grep db_kodus_postgres
docker ps | grep db_kodus_mongodb
```

2. Verify database logs:

```bash
docker logs db_kodus_postgres
docker logs db_kodus_mongodb
```

3. Test database connections:

```bash
docker exec -it db_kodus_postgres psql -U $API_PG_DB_USERNAME -d $API_PG_DB_DATABASE
docker exec -it db_kodus_mongodb mongosh -u $API_MG_DB_USERNAME -p $API_MG_DB_PASSWORD
```

### "Migration failed due to missing vector type"

If you encounter the error "type vector does not exist" during migrations, this is because the pgvector extension is not enabled in your PostgreSQL database. Here's how to fix it:

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
docker exec -it db_kodus_postgres psql -U $API_PG_DB_USERNAME -d $API_PG_DB_DATABASE
```

2. Enable the pgvector extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

3. After enabling the extension, try running your migrations again:

```bash
docker exec -it kodus-api-prod npm run migration:run
```

If you're still experiencing issues, you can verify the extension is properly installed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';
```

## Common Problems

### RabbitMQ Issues

If you're seeing message queue errors:

1. Check RabbitMQ status:

```bash
docker logs rabbitmq-prod
```

2. Access the management console at `http://localhost:15672` to verify queues and connections

3. Restart the service if needed:

```bash
docker restart rabbitmq-prod
```

### Resource Problems

If services are slow or crashing:

1. Check resource usage:

```bash
docker stats
```

2. Verify container limits:

```bash
docker inspect kodus-orchestrator-prod | grep -A 5 "Resources"
```

3. Adjust resource limits in docker-compose.yml if needed
