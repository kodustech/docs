### 1. Installing the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @kodus/cli
```

### 2. Installation Process

Detailed walkthrough of the `kodus install` command, including:

- Required configuration inputs
- Database setup options (local/external)
- AI API configuration (Google Vertex, OpenAI, Novita AI)
- Environment variables setup

### LLM API Keys Resources

When prompted during installation, you'll need API keys for AI providers. Use these official resources:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OpenAI API Key">
    Visit the [OpenAI API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to create and manage your keys.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Google AI / Vertex AI">
    Follow the [Google Cloud API setup guide](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys) to create your credentials.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Anthropic Claude">
    Get started with the [Anthropic API documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Novita AI">
    Access the [Novita AI Developer portal](https://novita.ai/docs/guides/quickstart) for API information.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Setting Up a Reverse Proxy

To make your Kodus instance accessible from external systems (required for Code Review webhooks), you'll need to configure a reverse proxy with Nginx.

Here's a sample Nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name kodus.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Save this configuration to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/kodus` and create a symbolic link to enable it:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/kodus /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t  # Test the configuration
sudo systemctl reload nginx  # Apply the changes
```

## Post-Installation Guide

After successfully installing Kodus with the CLI, follow these steps to get the most out of your deployment:

### Completing Initial Setup

Once you access the web interface for the first time, you'll need to:

1. **Create your admin account** - This will be the first user with full system access
2. **Configure your Git provider** - Connect GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket following the on-screen instructions
3. **Select repositories** for analysis - Choose which code repositories Kody will review

<Info>
  For detailed steps on the initial configuration process, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](/how_to_use/en/quickstart).
</Info>

### Updating Kodus

To update your Kodus installation to the latest version:

```bash
# Pull the latest images
docker-compose pull

# Restart the services with the new images
docker-compose up -d
```

### Enabling SSL (Recommended)

For production deployments, we strongly recommend setting up SSL:

```bash
# Install Certbot for Let's Encrypt
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Obtain and install certificates
sudo certbot --nginx -d kodus.yourdomain.com
```

## Accessing Service Logs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Core Services Logs">
    ```bash
    # Kodus Web logs
    docker logs kodus-web-prod

    # Orchestrator logs
    docker logs kodus-orchestrator-prod

    # Access log files directly from orchestrator
    docker exec -it kodus-orchestrator-prod ls /app/logs
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Database Logs">
    ```bash
    # PostgreSQL logs
    docker logs db_kodus_postgres

    # MongoDB logs
    docker logs db_kodus_mongodb
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Infrastructure Service Logs">
    ```bash
    # RabbitMQ logs
    docker logs rabbitmq-prod

    # Access RabbitMQ Management Console
    # Available at http://localhost:15672 (default credentials in your .env file)

    # Prometheus logs
    docker logs prometheus-prod

    # Grafana logs
    docker logs grafana-prod
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Web Interface Not Accessible">
    If you cannot access the web interface after installation:
    
    ```bash
    # Check if containers are running
    docker ps | grep kodus-web-prod
    
    # Verify port mappings
    docker port kodus-web-prod
    
    # Check web application logs
    docker logs kodus-web-prod
    ```
    
    **Common solutions:**
    - Ensure ports 3000 and 3001 are open in your firewall
    - Verify your Nginx configuration is correct
    - Check for SSL certificate issues if using HTTPS
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Git Webhook Connection Errors">
    If webhooks from your Git provider aren't reaching Kodus:
    
    ```bash
    # Check orchestrator logs for webhook activity
    docker logs kodus-orchestrator-prod | grep webhook
    ```
    
    **Common solutions:**
    - Verify your public URL is correctly configured
    - Ensure your Git provider can reach your Kodus instance
    - Check the webhook configuration in your Git provider
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Database Connection Issues">
    If services are failing due to database connectivity problems:
    
    ```bash
    # Check database status
    docker ps | grep db_kodus_postgres
    docker ps | grep db_kodus_mongodb
    
    # View initialization logs
    docker logs db_kodus_postgres
    docker logs db_kodus_mongodb
    ```
    
    **Common solutions:**
    - Restart the database containers
    - Check for disk space issues
    - Verify your .env file has correct database credentials
