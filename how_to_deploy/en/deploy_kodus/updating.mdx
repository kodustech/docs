To update your Kodus installation to the latest version:

```bash
# Navigate to your Kodus installation directory
cd kodus-installer

# Pull the latest changes from the repository
git pull

# If you are upgrading from 1.x, update your .env with the new 2.0 variables
# (RabbitMQ, MCP Manager, and webhooks).

# Re-run the installer to pull images, start services, and run migrations
./scripts/install.sh

# Optional: run diagnostics
./scripts/doctor.sh
```
