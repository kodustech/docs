title: "Deploy Kodus on a Generic Virtual Machine"
description: "Deployment doesn't have to be complicated. We've streamlined the process to get Kodus up and running on virtually any VM with minimal effort."
---



## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Node.js
- Yarn or NPM
- A Virtual Machine

> **Note**: Internet access is only required if you plan to connect with cloud-based Git services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. For self-hosted Git tools within your network, external internet access is optional.

## Deployment Process

### 1. Domain Name Setup (Optional)

If you're planning to integrate Kodus with cloud-based Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), you'll need a domain name or fixed IP address. This allows your server to receive webhooks for proper Code Review functionality.

We recommend using a subdomain like `kodus.yourdomain.com`. After acquiring your domain, configure the DNS records to point to your server's IP address.

> **Note**: If you're only connecting to self-hosted Git tools on your network, you can skip this step.

### 2. Get the Kodus Installer

Clone our installer repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kodustech/kodus-installer.git
cd kodus-installer
```

### 3. Run the Installation Script

<Tip>
  Looking for more control? Check out our [docker-compose file](https://github.com/kodustech/kodus-installer/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) for manual deployment options.
</Tip>

Set the proper permissions for the installation script:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
```

Run the script:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

### .env variables that you need to change

- `KODUS_ORCHESTRATOR_API_URL`: The URL of the Kodus Orchestrator API.
- `KODUS_WEB_APP_URL`: The URL of the Kodus Web Application.
- `KODUS_GIT_PROVIDER`: The Git provider you want to use.
- `KODUS_GIT_PROVIDER_API_KEY`: The API key for the Git provider.


### What the Installer Does

Our installer automates several important steps:

- Verifies Docker installation
- Creates networks for Kodus services
- Clones repositories and configures environment files
- Runs docker-compose to start all services
- Executes database migrations
- Seeds initial data

ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** When complete, Kodus Orchestrator API and Web Application should be running on your machine.

You can verify your installation by visiting `http://localhost:3000` - you should see the Kodus Web Application interface.

<Warning>
  Code Review features will not work yet unless you complete the reverse proxy setup. Without this configuration, external Git providers cannot send webhooks to your instance.
</Warning>

## Setting Up a Reverse Proxy

To make your Kodus instance accessible from external systems (required for Code Review webhooks), you'll need to configure a reverse proxy with Nginx.

Here's a sample Nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name kodus.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Save this configuration to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/kodus` and create a symbolic link to enable it:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/kodus /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t  # Test the configuration
sudo systemctl reload nginx  # Apply the changes
```

## Next Steps

After successfully deploying Kodus on your VM, consider these additional configurations:

1. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt for secure connections
2. Configure your Git provider to use your new Kodus instance
3. Invite your team and start improving your code review process
