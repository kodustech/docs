## Overview

<img src="/images/kodus-architecture.png" alt="Kodus Architecture" />

This document outlines the architecture powering Kodus's infrastructure. Our system is built on a distributed architecture that leverages containerization and network segmentation to ensure maximum scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Networks and Key Components

The infrastructure is strategically divided into two primary networks:

- kodus-backend-services: Orchestrates our core and auxiliary services
- kodus-shared-services: Houses our shared infrastructure components

## Components

### 1. Kodus Web Application

Our frontend platform is built with Next.js, delivering a seamless user experience through direct communication with our API layer.

### 2. Kodus Orchestrator Docker Container

This container serves as the backbone of our infrastructure, managing our core backend services:

- Next API: Our central service layer handling business logic and request processing
- Postgres: Enterprise-grade relational database for structured data
- MongoDB: High-performance NoSQL database for flexible data storage

### 3. Auxiliary Services (Aux Services)

Our auxiliary services run in isolated containers, each providing specialized functionality:

- ðŸ”’ Kodus Service Billing (closed source): Handles payment processing and subscription management
- ðŸ”’ Kodus Service Analytics (closed source): Powers our data analytics and platform insights
- Kodus Service Slack: Enables seamless Slack integration
- Kodus Service Discord: Provides Discord community integration
- Kodus Function GitLab Refresh Token: Manages GitLab authentication lifecycle

### 4. Shared Infrastructure (kodus-infrastructure)

Our shared services network (kodus-shared-services) provides critical infrastructure support:

RabbitMQ: Enterprise message broker enabling reliable asynchronous communication

Prometheus: Advanced monitoring and metrics collection system

Grafana: Sophisticated visualization platform for real-time metrics analysis
