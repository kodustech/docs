## Models Used

Kodus leverages cutting-edge language models for unstructured data processing and advanced analysis. The models currently in use are:

- **GPT-4o and derivatives**: An advanced language model developed by OpenAI, known for its high-quality text comprehension and generation capabilities.
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro and derivatives**: A multimodal model from Google, capable of processing and generating text, images, and other types of data.
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet and derivatives**: A language model by Anthropic, designed with a focus on safety and ethical alignment.

## Data Handling

### Temporary Use

All data processed by these models is used solely for temporary contextualization, which means:

- Data is retained only for the duration of the processing session.
- After task completion, data is immediately discarded.

### No Training Usage

In line with our agreements with model providers:

- No customer data is used to train or improve the models.
- Privacy and confidentiality of information are rigorously maintained.

2. **Data Isolation**: Models are designed not to store or retain data after processing.

3. **Controlled Access**: We enforce strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can interact with systems processing customer data.

4. **Regular Audits**: We conduct periodic security audits to ensure compliance with industry best practices.

5. **Security Updates**: All systems and models are regularly updated with the latest security patches.
