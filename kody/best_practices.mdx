To make the most out of Kody, here are some best practices to help you communicate effectively and get accurate, helpful responses.

### 1. Use Clear and Specific Language

When asking Kody a question, be as clear and specific as possible. This helps Kody understand exactly what you need.

- **Good Example**: `"@Kody, review the code in PR #123 for security issues"`
- **Not as Effective**: `"@Kody, check my code"`

Clear questions lead to precise answers, saving you time.

### 2. Reference Code or Context When Possible

If you’re asking about specific code, provide the relevant details or code snippets directly in your message.

- **Example**: `"@Kody, generate documentation for this function: function calculateTotal(items) {...}"`
- **Tip**: For code reviews, you can mention the PR number, file name, or function name to guide Kody to the exact section.

### 3. Ask One Question at a Time

Kody is designed to respond best to individual, specific questions. Avoid combining multiple questions in a single message for optimal results.

- **Good Example**:

  - `"@Kody, what are our current DORA metrics?"`
  - `"@Kody, suggest improvements for sprint velocity"`

- **Not as Effective**: `"@Kody, what are our DORA metrics and can you also suggest improvements for sprint velocity?"`

### 4. Utilize Command Templates for Common Tasks

For frequent tasks, like checking team metrics or performing code reviews, use command templates for faster interactions.

- **Examples**:
  - `"@Kody, show team productivity metrics for this sprint"`
  - `"@Kody, perform a code review on PR #456"`
  - `"@Kody, document the class UserAuthentication"`

Using these common phrases ensures that Kody understands your request accurately every time.

### 5. Check Language Settings for Better Response Accuracy

Make sure Kody’s language settings align with your preferred language for responses. This improves clarity and helps Kody provide answers in the format you expect.

- **How to Check**: Go to **Settings > Language** in your Kody dashboard to confirm your language preference.

### 6. Be Concise but Include Necessary Details

Try to keep your messages concise, but ensure you provide the context needed for Kody to respond accurately.

- **Good Example**: `"@Kody, analyze the bottlenecks in our latest PR reviews"`
- **Not as Effective**: `"@Kody, we’re experiencing delays in reviews; can you check why it’s slow?"`

### 7. Experiment with Synonyms for Best Results

If Kody doesn’t understand a specific request, try rephrasing with synonyms or adjusting your wording slightly.

- **Examples**:
  - Instead of `"show delays in code releases"`, try `"show blockers in deployment"`
  - Instead of `"generate API documentation"`, try `"create API reference docs"`

### 8. Ask for Help If You’re Unsure

If you’re not sure how to phrase a question, ask Kody for examples. Kody can provide templates or suggestions to help you format your query effectively.

- **Example**: `"@Kody, how can I ask you to review code for performance?"`
