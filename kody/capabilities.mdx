## Capabilities Overview

Kody is designed to make your engineering workflow smarter and faster. With two core types of capabilities—**Agents** and **Tools**—you get a dedicated assistant that fits right into your dev process, helping you ship better code with less hassle.

### What are Agents?

**Agents** are like having specialists on demand, each focused on different parts of your workflow. Whether it’s code reviews, documentation, testing, or keeping your team on track, each agent does the heavy lifting for you. Just ask Kody, and the right agent will jump in to help with targeted insights, recommendations, or even hands-on tasks.

For example:

- **CodeReviewer** provides detailed feedback on code quality.
- **TeamCoach** checks in on team health and productivity.

### What are Tools?

**Tools** are the gears that make Kody work. These are the functions that power each agent—connecting to your codebase, fetching data, analyzing it, and responding to your requests. Think of tools as the invisible hands that pull in the data, check statuses, and get answers, so you can focus on building, not digging for details.

If agents are the specialists, tools are the operations behind the scenes.

## Agents

### TeamCoach

Keeps your team sharp with real-time insights on productivity, workflows, and blockers. TeamCoach also guides on agile practices and sprint planning to keep things moving smoothly.

### CodeBuddy

Your go-to pair programmer. CodeBuddy helps debug, suggests optimizations, and guides you through complex code, making coding feel collaborative and efficient.

### CodeReviewer

Gives in-depth feedback on code quality, style, and potential issues to keep your codebase clean, secure, and scalable. CodeReviewer highlights improvements, just like a senior dev reviewing your PRs.

### DocHelper

Handles all things documentation. DocHelper helps you create, update, and organize documentation to keep your project info accessible and consistent.

### TestHelper

Generates unit and integration tests automatically, making sure your code is reliable and covered, saving time on manual test writing.

### ReleaseHelper

Smooths out the release process with well-organized notes, dependency checks, and code readiness verification, making sure your releases go out seamlessly.

### DataAnalyst

Digs into metrics and data to bring you actionable insights on trends, team performance, and project status. DataAnalyst turns numbers into meaningful advice.

### GenericAgent

The fallback agent for general questions, ready to respond when you’re not sure which agent to ask.

## Tools

### CodeConversation

Connects you to your codebase via language models, letting you ask questions, generate docs, and get detailed explanations without leaving your flow.

### CodeReview

Performs a structured review on code quality, efficiency, and best practices, making it easy to keep standards high.

### GetPullRequestTool

Grabs details from pull requests—author, message, creation date, review status—so you know who’s been contributing and what’s in progress.

### GetColumnsConfig

Breaks down board columns into WIP, Done, and To-Do, giving a clear picture of your board layout and flow.

### GetEpics

Lists high-level work items (epics) and their related tasks, helping you track major objectives and their progress.

### GetSprint

Tracks current and upcoming sprints, with dates, status, and task links to keep you in sync with sprint goals.

### GetWorkItemTypes

Defines all task categories like bugs, stories, and tasks, so you can set up and customize workflows effectively.

### GetWorkItems

Fetches work items by status, time frame, or type, keeping you on top of tasks.

### GetDeliveryEstimation

Estimates delivery dates for tasks using data-backed probabilities (p50, p75, p95), making planning and risk assessment easier.

### GetTeamMetrics

Tracks team performance metrics like Throughput and Lead Time with real-time and historical comparisons for insights on productivity trends.

### GetWorkItemsDeliveryStatus

Shows task status (delayed or on track) to give visibility into progress and workload balance.

### GetArtifacts

Highlights productivity and efficiency patterns, identifying challenges and wins in team dynamics.

### DataAnalysis

Processes data for trend detection, metric calculation, and actionable insights, giving you a complete view of project health.

### CodeExecution

Executes code snippets, runs algorithms, debugs, and validates concepts directly within Kody.

### WebSearch

Pulls up relevant and recent info from the web for background, documentation, or solution searching.
