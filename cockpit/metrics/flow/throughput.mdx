## Description

The number of items completed within a specific period.

## How We Calculate It

Using your project management tool, we retrieve all items that reached the Done column within a given period.

## Why It Matters

Monitoring Throughput is essential to understand the team’s delivery capacity over a specific period. Consistent and high Throughput indicates a productive and efficient team, while variations or low values may signal issues or bottlenecks in the process.

## How to Use Throughput

### Use Cases

- **Productivity Assessment**: Use Throughput to evaluate team productivity over time and identify trends or changes in efficiency.
- **Planning and Capacity**: Utilize Throughput data to plan for future sprints or work periods, helping to predict the team’s delivery capacity.
- **Identifying Improvements**: Analyzing Throughput can help identify areas in the process that may be optimized to improve delivery speed and efficiency.
