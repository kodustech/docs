![Bug Ratio Representation](https://kodus.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bugratio.png)

## Description

The percentage of bugs relative to the total number of items in WIP (Work In Progress).

## How We Calculate It

Using your project management tool, we sum all items in WIP on the board and all bugs. Then, we calculate the percentage of bugs relative to the total items.

## Why It Matters

Monitoring the Bug Ratio is essential for understanding the quality of your workflow and the efficiency of your development process. A high bug ratio can indicate issues with code quality, inadequate review processes, or insufficient testing, ultimately impacting the delivery of value to the customer.

## How to Use Bug Ratio

Regularly monitoring the Bug Ratio can help identify quality issues in the code and development processes.

## Use Cases

- **Identifying Quality Issues**: An increase in the Bug Ratio may indicate that new features are introducing too many bugs, requiring a review of the development process or improvements in test coverage.
- **Process Improvement**: If the Bug Ratio remains consistently high, it may be necessary to invest in better coding practices, stricter code reviews, or more automated testing.
- **Continuous Improvement Metric**: Using the Bug Ratio as a metric for continuous improvement helps the team focus on code quality and process efficiency, promoting faster deliveries with fewer defects.
