## Description

Delivery Capacity measures the balance between the number of new items entering your development pipeline and the number of items your team completes (Throughput).

## How We Calculate It

Using your project management tool, we track the number of new items entering the workflow and the number of items completed in a set timeframe. This gives us a clear comparison of input versus output, so you can see if your team’s workload is balanced or if adjustments are needed.

## Why It Matters

Maintaining a good balance between incoming and completed items is key to keeping your team on track and avoiding overload. When Delivery Capacity is balanced, you can predict timelines more accurately and make adjustments to improve team performance. This metric highlights if you need to reprioritize tasks or adjust your team’s delivery capacity.

## Use Cases

- **Adjusting Priorities**: If incoming items consistently exceed capacity, use this metric to help re-prioritize critical tasks and focus on what drives the most value.
- **Workload Sustainability**: Tracking Delivery Capacity over time reveals when workload levels are becoming unsustainable, which can help prevent burnout and keep productivity high.

- **Process and Efficiency Check**: A drop or imbalance in delivery capacity may signal workflow issues or bottlenecks, making it easier to spot where to improve.
