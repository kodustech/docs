## Description

Flow Efficiency measures the percentage of time spent in each stage of your workflow, giving insights into how your team’s time is distributed from start to finish.

## How We Calculate It

We look at the 75th percentile (p75) Lead Time for each stage on your project management board. Then, we calculate the percentage that each stage represents in the overall workflow duration, from when an item enters development until it’s marked complete.

## Why It Matters

Flow Efficiency helps pinpoint stages in the workflow that may be slowing things down. Low-complexity stages that take up too much time, or bottlenecks in waiting stages like "Awaiting Testing" or "Ready for Release," are flagged so you can make targeted adjustments to optimize the flow.

## Use Cases

- **Reducing Idle Time**: Identifying stages with prolonged idle times, like “Awaiting Testing” or “Ready for Release,” allows teams to address these bottlenecks or streamline steps for specific items, such as bug fixes that don’t require a full review cycle.

- **Team Performance Analysis**: By assessing the overall flow efficiency, you can see where most of the time goes and understand the impact on delivery. This makes it easier to adjust workflows for better predictability and efficiency.

- **Resource Allocation and Prioritization**: Knowing which stages consume the most time lets you allocate resources better—for example, by dedicating more team members to critical or slower-moving stages—and prioritize tasks that speed up delivery.
