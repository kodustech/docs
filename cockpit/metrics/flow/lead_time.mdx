## Description

The time it takes for an item to move from column X to column Y.

## How We Calculate It

Using your project management tool, we retrieve all items from the past 90 days. We then calculate the time for each type of lead time:

- **Lead Time:** The time from when a task is created to when it’s completed (Done column).
- **Lead Time in WIP:** The time from when development begins (first WIP column) to when it’s completed (Done column).
- **Lead Time by Item Type:** Lead Time and Lead Time in WIP categorized by item type in the project management tool.

## Why It Matters

Monitoring Lead Time is essential for understanding workflow efficiency and the speed at which the team delivers value. A shorter Lead Time generally indicates a more efficient and agile process, while a longer Lead Time may signal bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

## How to Use Lead Time

### Use Cases

- **Identifying Bottlenecks**: Analyzing Lead Time can help pinpoint stages in the process that are taking longer than expected, allowing the team to take action to resolve these bottlenecks.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use Lead Time as a performance metric to implement continuous improvement practices and increase team efficiency.
- **Planning and Estimation**: Use historical Lead Time data to make more accurate estimates and improve planning for future deliveries.
