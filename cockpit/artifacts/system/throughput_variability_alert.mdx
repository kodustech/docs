title: "High Variability in Throughput"
---

## How It Works

We analyze the last 5 weeks or sprints (minimum of 3) to check for variability in the team’s throughput. If the variation exceeds 30%, an alert is triggered.

If the team does not yet have at least 3 historical data points (weeks or sprints), this metric will not be calculated.

## Why Is This Important?

High variability in throughput can indicate issues with delivery consistency. Maintaining stable throughput is essential for effective planning and meeting stakeholder expectations.

## Benefits

1. **Inconsistency Detection**: Identifying fluctuations in throughput helps detect process issues and find solutions to stabilize output.
2. **Improved Planning**: With more predictable throughput, delivery planning becomes more reliable and efficient.
3. **Increased Team Confidence**: Reducing variability boosts the team’s confidence in their ability to meet deadlines and deliver value consistently.

## Tips to Reduce Throughput Variability

- **Process Stabilization**: Review and stabilize work processes to reduce variation and increase predictability.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure resources are well-managed and workloads are balanced.
- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of work practices and adjust as needed to maintain steady throughput.
