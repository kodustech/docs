title: "Decrease in Team Velocity"
---

## How It Works

We use Lead Time to calculate team velocity. By analyzing all tasks on the board with Kody's algorithm, we validate whether tasks are moving slower than usual. If over 30% of activities are in this condition, an alert is generated.

## Why Is This Important?

Maintaining team velocity is crucial to meeting delivery deadlines and stakeholder expectations. A decrease in velocity can indicate process issues, workload overload, or other concerns that need quick resolution.

## Benefits

1. **Bottleneck Identification**: Detecting a drop in velocity helps identify potential bottlenecks or workflow issues.
2. **Efficiency Improvement**: Addressing the root causes of reduced velocity enables the team to work more efficiently and productively.
3. **On-Time Delivery**: Ensuring the team maintains a steady velocity is key to meeting deadlines and delivering value to clients.

## Tips to Maintain Team Velocity

- **Regular Process Review**: Regularly assess processes to identify and remove obstacles that could be slowing down the team.
- **Balanced Task Distribution**: Ensure tasks are evenly distributed among team members to prevent overload.
