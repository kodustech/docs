title: "Significant Increase in Bugs in Deliveries"
---

## How It Works

We monitor the Bug Ratio metric, analyzing the weekly number of bugs. If it exceeds 40%, an alert is generated.

## Why Is This Important?

A significant increase in bugs can indicate issues with code quality, insufficient testing, or inefficient review processes. Quickly identifying and addressing these problems is essential to maintain delivery quality and ensure customer satisfaction.

## Benefits

1. **Early Detection of Quality Issues**: Identifying an increase in the Bug Ratio helps you take prompt action to resolve issues before they cause larger impacts.
2. **Improved Product Quality**: Monitoring and reducing the Bug Ratio leads to a more stable and reliable end product.
3. **Increased Customer Confidence**: Reducing the number of bugs in deliveries boosts customer trust in the product’s quality and the team’s ability to deliver robust solutions.

## Tips to Reduce Bug Ratio

- **Test Automation**: Implement automated tests to quickly identify and fix bugs.
- **Code Review**: Adopt strict code review practices to ensure new changes do not introduce additional bugs.
- **Continuous Feedback**: Collect ongoing user feedback to identify and address issues before they become critical.
