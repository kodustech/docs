---

## How It Works

We analyze team-level flow issue artifacts generated over the past three weeks. If the number of artifacts has increased by more than 30% compared to the average, an alert is triggered.

## Why Is This Important?

Maintaining high flow quality and following best practices are essential for team efficiency and productivity. Identifying drops in flow quality allows teams to address issues quickly, preventing significant impacts on team performance.

## Benefits

1. **Early Problem Detection**: By spotting significant increases in flow issue artifacts, you can take action before issues escalate.
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Monitoring flow quality promotes a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging the team to consistently refine their practices and processes.
3. **Increased Efficiency**: With fewer disruptions and flow issues, the team can work more efficiently, delivering value more consistently.

## Tips for Maintaining Flow Quality

- **Clear Communication**: Ensure that all tasks and projects have well-defined and clear specifications.
- **Regular Check-ins**: Use check-ins to keep the team informed about the challenges that need to be addressed.
