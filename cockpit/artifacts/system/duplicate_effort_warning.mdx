title: "Teams Working on Potentially Duplicate Items"
---

## How It Works

Each week, we analyze all items that teams in your organization are working on. Using a generative AI model, we compare the titles and descriptions of items to identify potential duplicates.

## Why Is This Important?

Working on duplicate items is one of the biggest drains on engineering team resources. Depending on how teams are organized, this situation may be more common than you realize.

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Rework**: Identifying duplicates prevents two or more teams from working on the same issue, saving time and resources.
2. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Recognizing similar items fosters collaboration across teams, encouraging knowledge sharing and best practices.
3. **Increased Efficiency**: With fewer duplicate efforts, teams can focus on unique, critical tasks, boosting overall productivity.

## Practical Examples

- **Example 1**: Two teams are developing a similar feature for user profiles. Early identification allows teams to combine efforts and create a unified solution.
- **Example 2**: Multiple bug tickets report similar issues. Consolidating them helps prioritize and resolve the problem more efficiently.

## Tips to Avoid Duplication

- **Effective Communication**: Maintain clear communication across teams so everyone knows what others are working on.
- **Sync Meetings**: Hold regular sync meetings to discuss progress and prevent duplicated efforts.
- **Centralized Documentation**: Use a centralized documentation tool where everyone can view in-progress items and their descriptions.
