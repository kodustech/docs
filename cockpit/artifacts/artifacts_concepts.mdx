title: "Alerts"

Alerts are notifications generated based on team activity within work tools. Their purpose is to inform or warn about critical events happening within teams, allowing decision-makers to take action without spending hours diving into metrics or dashboards.

We have two levels of alerts:

## System-Level Alerts

System-level alerts provide management-level information. They offer a macro perspective, allowing senior management to make strategic decisions. These alerts typically present high-level information, giving a broad understanding of the organizationâ€™s overall status and performance.

## Team-Level Alerts

Team-level alerts provide operational insights. They often represent the root cause of issues identified in system-level alerts. These alerts are crucial for understanding key bottlenecks and challenges faced by teams, helping to resolve specific issues and improve operational efficiency.

## Importance of Alerts

Alerts are essential for effective management because they:

- **Facilitate Decision-Making**: Provide relevant, actionable information for managers at different levels of the organization.
- **Identify Problems Early**: Warn about potential issues before they significantly impact the project.
- **Promote Continuous Improvement**: Offer insights into team performance, allowing for ongoing adjustments and process improvements.

By using alerts effectively, organizations can enhance efficiency, resolve issues faster, and ensure that projects are delivered with quality and within established timelines.
