## How We Calculate It

We calculate the Bug Ratio by dividing the number of PRs labeled as bugs or fixes by the total number of PRs.

## Why It Matters

The Bug Ratio helps identify the proportion of PRs that are related to bugs or fixes. High ratios may indicate a need for better testing practices or more efficient issue resolution.
