### 1. Collecting Feedback

Kody learns from three main sources:

- **Direct Reactions**: Team members can react to Kody's suggestions on GitHub/GitLab:

  - 👍 = "This is what we want"
  - 👎 = "This doesn't match our style"

- **Implementation Tracking**: When your team implements Kody's suggestions, she marks it as positive feedback

- **Pattern Recognition**: Kody builds knowledge clusters based on your team's preferences

### 2. Smart Filtering

Once Kody has enough data, she:

1. Analyzes new code suggestions
2. Compares them against your team's preference clusters
3. Only shows suggestions that match your team's style
4. Filters out suggestions similar to previously rejected ones

## Why Your Feedback Matters

The more feedback you provide, the better Kody becomes at:

- ✅ Matching your coding style
- 🎯 Making relevant suggestions
- 🚫 Avoiding unwanted patterns
- 💡 Understanding team preferences

## Best Practices

1. **Be Consistent**: Encourage the team to provide feedback regularly
2. **React Promptly**: Give feedback while the context is fresh
3. **Team Alignment**: Ensure the team agrees on what makes a good suggestion
