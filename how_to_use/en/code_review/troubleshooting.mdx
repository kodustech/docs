## Kody Code Review Not Working? Steps to Fix Common Issues

### Token Issues

If you're connected via a token, ensure these points are checked:

- **GitHub Users**: Verify that your token is enabled for your organization:
  1. You must be the organization owner.
  2. Go to your organization's settings in GitHub:
     - Use the following URL and replace `YOUR_ORG_NAME` with the name of your organization:
       <small>
         `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG_NAME/settings/member_privileges`
       </small>
       .
  3. Under **Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens**, ensure **"Allow access via fine-grained personal access tokens"** is selected.
- **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Confirm that your token is configured for your organization and has the required permissions. [Manage tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
- **Token Expiry**: Make sure your token is active. [Check token status](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).

### Configuration Issues

- **Automated Reviews**: Ensure automated reviews are enabled in your [Global Settings](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general). If disabled, start reviews manually with `@kody start-review`.
- **Review Types**: Ensure at least one review type is selected for Kody to provide suggestions. [Configure review types](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general).
- **Branch Reviews**: By default, Kody reviews PRs merged into the default branch. To include additional branches, [update your configuration](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general).
- **Large PRs**: Be aware that PRs with a high number of changes may take longer to process.

### Global vs. Repository Settings

Kody uses a hierarchical configuration system. Here's how it works:

- **Global Settings**: Applied to all repositories by default.
- **Repository-Specific Settings**: If configured, they will override global settings for that specific repository.

#### Steps to Troubleshoot

1. **Check Global Configuration**: Review and confirm global settings are correct. [Access Global Settings](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general).
2. **Verify Repository Settings**:
   - Navigate to the **By Repositories** section in your settings.
   - Confirm if custom configurations are set for the repository in question.
3. **Align or Clear Configurations**:
   - To apply global settings, clear any repository-specific configurations.
   - Alternatively, adjust the repository-specific settings to meet your needs.

#### Common Symptoms

- Automated reviews are not triggered for a repository.
- Kody applies unexpected settings or suggestions.
- Global settings are not reflected in specific repositories.


## No Response or No Comments from Kody

Work through this quick checklist:

1. PR contains reviewable code changes (not only docs or images)? Kody may skip if there's nothing relevant to analyze.
2. Branch is in scope? By default, only PRs targeting the default branch are reviewed unless additional base branches are configured.
3. **Large PRs:** Kody reviews PRs with up to 200 **reviewable files** (after applying ignore patterns). Example: PR with 250 total files but 60 are `.lock` files → Kody reviews the remaining 190 files ✅
4. Mode: If automated reviews are disabled, trigger manually with `@kody start-review`.
5. Push cadence: If using auto-pause, wait for the cool-down or request a manual review.
6. Repository overrides: Repo-specific settings can override global ones. Clear or align them as needed.
