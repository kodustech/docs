title: "Review Policy"

## Purpose

Clarify how to interpret Kody's feedback and how it interacts with your repository's merge policies.

## Suggestions vs. Blocking

- Suggestions: By default, Kody posts non-blocking comments for you to evaluate.
- Request Changes (optional): If enabled, Kody can mark a review as "changes requested" for critical issues.
- Auto-approve (optional): If enabled, Kody approves PRs when no issues are found.

<Note>
  Enable blocking behaviors only when your team agrees on the thresholds and has strong CI in place.
</Note>

## When to Enable Request Changes

- Security-sensitive areas where critical issues must never ship.
- Performance hotspots where regressions are costly.
- Repositories with clear coding standards and stable review rules.

## When to Use Auto-approve

- Small, low-risk changes (docs/tests).
- Teams with high test coverage and reliable CI.

## Human Decision Always Matters

Kody accelerates feedback but does not replace human judgment. Your team decides which suggestions to adopt and when to merge.
