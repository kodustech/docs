## How It Works

### 1. Accessing Rules Generation

Navigate to your repository settings:

1. Go to **Code Review Settings** → **Repository** → **Kody Rules**
2. Look for the **"Generate Kody Rules"** button
3. Click to start the automatic generation process

### 2. Analysis Process

When you click "Generate Kody Rules", Kody will:

- **Scan Review History**: Analyzes the last 3 months of code reviews in your repository
- **Identify Patterns**: Discovers common feedback themes and coding preferences
- **Extract Standards**: Converts review patterns into actionable rules
- **Generate Suggestions**: Creates custom rule suggestions tailored to your team's style

### 3. Reviewing Generated Rules

Once the analysis is complete:

1. A **"Check Out New Rules"** button will appear
2. Click to review the generated rule suggestions
3. Browse through the proposed rules and their explanations
4. **Important**: Rules are not active yet - they are only suggestions at this point

### 4. Importing Rules (Required for Activation)

<Warning>
  **Critical Step**: Generated rules will NOT take effect until you manually
  import them.
</Warning>

To make the rules active:

- **Choose Selectively**: Import only the rules that match your team's needs
- **Customize**: Modify rules before importing if needed
- **Apply**: Add selected rules to your active rule set
- **Activation**: Only imported rules will be enforced during code reviews

## Continuous Learning

After the initial setup, Kody maintains an ongoing learning cycle:

- **Weekly Updates**: Kody generates new rule suggestions every week
- **Evolving Standards**: Rule suggestions adapt as your team's coding style evolves
- **Refined Accuracy**: Suggestions become more precise over time
- **Regular Reviews**: New rule suggestions appear for your review weekly

## Requirements

- **Minimum Data**: At least 3 months of review history in the repository
- **Active Reviews**: Regular code review activity for better pattern detection
- **Repository Access**: Proper permissions to modify repository rules
