## How Custom Prompts Work

Custom Prompts operate at three levels:

### Category Prompts

Define what Kody looks for in each review category:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bug">
    **Focus:** Code correctness and execution issues
    
    Default coverage:
    - Execution breaks (unhandled exceptions)
    - Wrong results (incorrect output)
    - Resource leaks (files, connections, memory)
    - State corruption (invalid object/data states)
    - Logic errors (incorrect control flow)
    - Race conditions (concurrent access issues)
    
    **Max length:** 2000 characters
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Security">
    **Focus:** Security vulnerabilities and data protection
    
    Default coverage:
    - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL/NoSQL/command/LDAP)
    - Auth/AuthN flaws (missing checks, privilege escalation)
    - Data exposure (sensitive data in logs/responses)
    - Crypto issues (weak algorithms, hardcoded keys)
    - Input validation gaps (missing sanitization/bounds checks)
    - Session management (predictable tokens, missing expiration)
    
    **Max length:** 2000 characters
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Performance">
    **Focus:** Speed, efficiency, and resource optimization
    
    Default coverage:
    - Algorithm complexity (O(n²) when O(n) possible)
    - Redundant operations (duplicate calculations, unnecessary loops)
    - Memory waste (large allocations, leaks)
    - Blocking operations (synchronous I/O in critical paths)
    - Database inefficiency (N+1, missing indexes, full scans)
    - Cache misses (not leveraging available caching)
    
    **Max length:** 2000 characters
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Severity Prompts

Define how Kody classifies issue severity:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Critical">
    **Definition:** Issues requiring immediate attention
    
    Default examples:
    - Application crash/downtime
    - Data loss/corruption
    - Security breach (unauthorized access/data exfiltration)
    - Critical operation failure (auth/payment/authorization)
    - Direct financial loss operations
    - Memory leaks causing inevitable crash
    
    **Max length:** 2000 characters
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="High">
    **Definition:** Significant issues needing near-term resolution
    
    Default examples:
    - Important functionality broken
    - Memory leaks causing eventual crash
    - Performance degradation affecting UX under normal load
    - Security issues with indirect exploitation paths
    - Financial calculation errors affecting revenue
    
    **Max length:** 2000 characters
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Medium">
    **Definition:** Moderate improvements recommended
    
    Default examples:
    - Partially broken functionality
    - Performance issues in specific scenarios
    - Security weaknesses requiring specific conditions
    - Incorrect but recoverable data
    - Non-critical business logic errors with workarounds
    
    **Max length:** 2000 characters
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Low">
    **Definition:** Minor enhancements for incremental improvement
    
    Default examples:
    - Minor performance overhead
    - Low-risk security improvements
    - Incorrect metrics/logs
    - Rarely affecting few users
    - Edge-case issues
    
    **Max length:** 2000 characters
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Suggestion Prompts

Control how Kody communicates each individual suggestion. This customizes the message format and tone that appears in PR comments, like:

```
The new file 'create-or-update-issues-parameter.dto.ts' does not follow 
the company's naming convention. According to the Kody Rules, all new files 
must use camelCase. Please rename the file to 'createOrUpdateIssuesParameter.dto.ts' 
to adhere to the standard.
```

Your custom prompt instructs Kody on how to write suggestion messages. The prompt receives context about the severity level, problem description, suggested code, and whether it's a Kody Rules violation. Kody uses this context along with your prompt to generate appropriate messages for each suggestion.

You can customize the tone, level of detail, and communication style based on your team's needs - from detailed explanations for critical issues to concise feedback for minor ones.

## Best Practices

### Be Specific to Your Context

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do: Context-Specific" icon="check">
    ```
    Bug category prompt:
    Focus on null pointer exceptions in our 
    Java services, unclosed database connections 
    in DAO layer, and race conditions in our 
    async event handlers. Check for proper 
    resource cleanup in try-finally blocks.
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't: Too Generic" icon="xmark">
    ```
    Bug category prompt:
    Look for bugs in the code.
    Check for issues and problems.
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Avoid Redundancy Between Prompts

Each category and severity should have a distinct focus. Don't repeat the same instructions across different prompts.

<Accordion title="Example: Proper Separation">
  **Bug Category:**
  Focus on execution correctness, null pointer exceptions, and resource cleanup in our Java services.

  **Security Category:**
  Focus on SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF in our API endpoints. Verify input sanitization and parameterized queries.

  **Performance Category:**
  Focus on N+1 queries, missing database indexes, and inefficient loops in data processing.

  **Result:** Each prompt has a clear, non-overlapping focus.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Anti-pattern: Redundant Prompts">
  **Bug Category:**
  Check for null pointers, SQL injection, and slow queries.

  **Security Category:**
  Look for SQL injection, null pointers, and performance issues.

  **Performance Category:**
  Find slow queries, null pointers, and security vulnerabilities.

  **Problem:** All prompts overlap, confusing the model and reducing review quality.
</Accordion>

### Be Careful with Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good: Pattern Description">
    ```
    Detect SQL injection in database queries:
    - Raw string concatenation in SQL statements
    - User input directly in query strings
    - Missing parameterized queries or ORMs
    - Dynamic query construction without sanitization
    ```
    
    This describes the pattern broadly, catching multiple variations.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Risky: Specific Example">
    ```
    Detect SQL injection like this:
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId
    ```
    
    The model might only flag this exact pattern and miss:
    - Template literals: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`
    - String formatting: `f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {userId}"`
    - Other SQL injection vectors
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Keep Suggestions Scannable

For suggestion prompts, make messages easy to scan since developers review many at once:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good: Clear Structure">
    ```
    Write suggestions with clear structure. For critical issues, 
    start with the 🚨 emoji, state the problem, then show "Fix:" 
    followed by the code. For other severities, keep it simple - 
    just the problem and the suggested code.
    
    Put important information first so developers can quickly 
    understand what needs to be done.
    ```
    
    Clear hierarchy, important information first
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Bad: Wall of Text">
    ```
    Explain the problem and why it's important because it could 
    cause issues in production and developers should fix it by 
    applying the suggested code changes that will resolve the issue.
    ```
    
    Hard to scan, buries the action
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Use Context Meaningfully

Only differentiate suggestion formats when there's a real reason:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good: Meaningful Difference">
    ```
    For Kody Rules violations, use a stricter tone: 
    "**Team Standard**: [problem]. Required: [code]"
    
    For standard suggestions, use a friendlier tone:
    "[problem]. Suggested: [code]"
    
    The difference in language makes the requirement level clear.
    ```
    
    Clear distinction: rules are requirements, suggestions are recommendations
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Bad: Superficial Label">
    ```
    For Kody Rules, add "[RULE]" prefix before the problem.
    For suggestions, add "[SUGGESTION]" prefix before the problem.
    Otherwise format them the same way.
    ```
    
    Just adding labels doesn't add value
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Industry-Specific Requirements">
    **Scenario:** Healthcare application with HIPAA compliance requirements
    
    **Custom Security Prompt:**
    ```
    Focus on HIPAA compliance in data handling:
    - PHI (Protected Health Information) exposure in logs or errors
    - Missing encryption for PHI at rest and in transit
    - Inadequate access controls for patient data
    - Audit logging gaps for PHI access
    - Data retention violations
    - Missing patient consent verification
    ```
    
    **Benefit:** Kody catches compliance-specific issues that generic security reviews might miss.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tech Stack Optimization">
    **Scenario:** React/Node.js application with specific patterns
    
    **Custom Bug Prompt:**
    ```
    Focus on React and Node.js common pitfalls:

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model-Specific Tuning">
    **Scenario:** Using Gemini 2.5 Flash via BYOK for cost optimization
    
    **Custom Performance Prompt:**
    ```
    Analyze algorithmic efficiency and resource usage.
    List specific issues in this format:
    1. Issue type and location
    2. Current complexity
    3. Optimization suggestion
    4. Expected improvement
    
    Prioritize: database queries, loops, memory allocations.
    ```
    
    **Benefit:** Structured output format that Gemini handles exceptionally well, improving review quality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Severity Calibration">
    **Scenario:** Startup moving fast, needs different severity thresholds
    
    **Custom Critical Prompt:**
    ```
    Only flag as Critical if:
    - Production data could be deleted or corrupted
    - Security breach allowing direct data exfiltration
    - Payment processing failures
    - Complete service outage for core features
    
    Note: Performance issues are never Critical unless causing crashes.
    ```
    
    **Benefit:** Reduces alert fatigue by aligning severity with business impact.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Severity-Based Communication">
    **Scenario:** Want detailed explanations for critical issues but concise feedback for minor ones
    
    **Custom Suggestion Prompt:**
    ```
    When writing suggestions, adjust the level of detail based on severity:
    
    For Critical issues: Start with "🚨 CRITICAL:" followed by the problem. 
    Add a line explaining "This requires immediate attention." Then provide 
    the fix with "Fix:" prefix.
    
    For High severity: Use "⚠️" emoji, state the problem, then show the fix 
    with "Fix:" prefix.
    
    For Medium and Low: Keep it brief - just state the problem and show the 
    suggested code directly without extra explanation.
    ```
    
    **Benefit:** Critical issues get extra context while minor issues stay brief, improving review efficiency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Direct and Concise Feedback">
    **Scenario:** Team prefers minimal, actionable feedback
    
    **Custom Suggestion Prompt:**
    ```
    Be direct and concise. State the problem in one sentence, then immediately 
    show the fix with "Fix:" prefix. No additional context or explanations.
    ```
    
    **Benefit:** Every suggestion is short and to-the-point without extra context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Educational Suggestions">
    **Scenario:** Junior developers benefit from detailed explanations
    
    **Custom Suggestion Prompt:**
    ```
    Structure suggestions in three parts:
    
    1. **Issue:** State the problem clearly
    2. **Why this matters:** Explain the impact based on severity:
       - Critical: Could cause production failures or security vulnerabilities
       - High: May lead to bugs or performance problems  
       - Medium/Low: Improves code quality and maintainability
    3. **Fix:** Show the recommended code change
    
    Make explanations educational and help developers learn why it matters.
    ```
    
    **Benefit:** Every suggestion includes educational context about importance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Different Tone for Rules vs Suggestions">
    **Scenario:** Kody Rules are strict requirements, suggestions are recommendations
    
    **Custom Suggestion Prompt:**
    ```
    Use different tones based on the type:
    
    For Kody Rules violations:
    - Start with "**Team Standard Violation**" in bold
    - State the problem
    - Add "This violates documented team standards."
    - Show "Required fix:" followed by the code
    
    For standard suggestions:
    - State the problem directly
    - Show "Suggested improvement:" followed by the code
    - Use a friendly, recommendatory tone
    ```
    
    **Benefit:** Clear distinction between mandatory rules and optional suggestions.
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Reviews Are Too Noisy">
    **Symptoms:** Too many low-value suggestions after customization
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Make prompts more specific and focused
    - Add exclusions for patterns you want to ignore
    - Raise minimum severity threshold in [Suggestion Control](/how_to_use/en/code_review/configs/suggestion_control)
    - Check for redundancy between category and severity prompts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Expected Issues">
    **Symptoms:** Kody doesn't catch issues it should
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Review your prompt for being too narrow or example-specific
    - Check if the issue falls under a category you didn't customize
    - Try resetting to default to see if the issue is caught
    - Consider if the issue might be classified under a different severity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inconsistent Results">
    **Symptoms:** Same type of issue flagged sometimes but not always
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Ensure prompts are clear and unambiguous
    - Remove conflicting instructions across different prompts
    - Check if you're using examples that are too specific
    - Consider if different models in primary/fallback have different capabilities
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Not Sure What to Customize">
    **Symptoms:** Want to use custom prompts but unsure where to start
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Start by running default reviews for a week
    - Note patterns in false positives or missed issues
    - Customize only the specific prompt related to those patterns
    - Keep other prompts at default until you see a clear need
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
