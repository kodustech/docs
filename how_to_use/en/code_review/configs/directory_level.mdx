title: "Directory-Level Settings"
description: "Target specific folders in your repo with custom code review settings. Ideal for monorepos."

## Overview

Directory-level review lets you assign a specific Code Review configuration to one or more folders in a repository. This is especially useful for monorepos or multi-service repos where different areas have different standards, languages, or ownership.

<Info>
  Kody always selects a single configuration to review a PR.
  The selection hierarchy is: <b>Directory</b> → <b>Repository</b> → <b>Global</b>.
</Info>

## How it works

- **Pick any folder at any depth** (for example: `api/src/services` or `api/src/services/users`).
- **Configure as many folders as you want**, as long as they **do not overlap**.
- **No nested/overlapping configs**: if you configure `api/src/services`, you cannot also configure `api/src/services/users` (or any subfolder inside `services`).

### Selection rules

- **PR touches files inside exactly one configured directory** (and other unconfigured areas): the entire PR is reviewed using that directory's configuration.
- **PR touches only unconfigured directories**: Kody uses the repository-level configuration. If the repository has no configuration, Kody uses the global configuration.
- **PR touches files from two or more configured directories**: Kody escalates to the repository-level configuration. If the repository has no configuration, Kody uses the global configuration.

<Note>
  Why only one config per PR? To keep reviews predictable and consistent. Mixing multiple configs in a single review leads to conflicts and confusing behavior.
</Note>

## Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single configured directory + others unconfigured">
    You configured `src/microservice-alpha`. The PR changes files in
    `src/microservice-alpha` and other folders with no specific config.
    
    Result: the whole PR is reviewed with the **microservice-alpha** configuration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="No configured directories touched">
    The PR changes files only in directories that do not have a specific configuration.
    
    Result: Kody uses the **repository** configuration; if none exists, Kody uses the **global** configuration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Two or more configured directories touched">
    You configured `src/microservice-alpha` and `src/microservice-beta`. The PR touches both.
    
    Result: Kody escalates to the **repository** configuration; if none exists, Kody uses the **global** configuration.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Constraints

- Configure **non-overlapping** directories only. Example of invalid combo:
  - Config for `api/src/services` and a second config for `api/src/services/users`.
- You can configure **many directories**, as long as none is inside another configured path.

## Setup (high level)

1. Open your repository's Code Review settings in the Kodus app.
2. Add one or more directory entries and assign the desired review configuration to each.
3. Save your changes. New PRs will follow the directory → repository → global selection rules.

<Info>
  If your team also uses a repo-level `kodus-config.yml`, the web settings are still subject to the repository config priority rules described in General settings.
