## Overview

Apply custom code review settings to specific folders in your repository. Ideal for monorepos where different areas have different standards or ownership.

Kody selects a single config per PR: **Directory** → **Repository** → **Global**

<Note>
  Learn how settings flow between levels in <a href="/how_to_use/en/code_review/configs/inheritance_overrides">Config Inheritance & Overrides</a>.
</Note>

## How it works

- Configure any folder at any depth (e.g., `api/src/services`)
- Configure as many folders as you want
- **No overlapping**: if you configure `api/src/services`, you cannot also configure `api/src/services/users`

### Selection rules

- **One configured directory touched**: Uses that directory's config
- **No configured directories touched**: Uses repository config (or global if no repo config)
- **Two or more configured directories touched**: Escalates to repository config (or global if no repo config)

<Note>
  Kody uses one config per PR to keep reviews predictable. Mixing configs causes conflicts.

## Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single configured directory">
    You configured `src/microservice-alpha`. PR changes files in `src/microservice-alpha` and unconfigured folders.
    
    Uses **microservice-alpha** config.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="No configured directories">
    PR only touches directories without specific configs.
    
    Uses **repository** config (or **global** if no repo config).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multiple configured directories">
    You configured `src/microservice-alpha` and `src/microservice-beta`. PR touches both.
    
    Escalates to **repository** config (or **global** if no repo config).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setup

1. Open your repository's Code Review settings
2. Add directory entries and assign configurations
3. Save changes

If you also use `kodus-config.yml`, it overrides web settings (see Config Priority in General settings).
