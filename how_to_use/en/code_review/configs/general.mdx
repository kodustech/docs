## Core Settings

### Global vs Per-Repo Config
- Global: Default rules for all repos
- Per-Repo: Override rules for specific repos

### Config Priority
`kodus-config.yml` in your repo overrides web settings when enabled.

## Review Behavior

### Automated Review

When **Enable Automated Code Review** is enabled, Kody will automatically review PRs when opened. When disabled, Kody only reviews when you comment `@kody start-review`.

#### Review Cadence

Choose how Kody should handle follow-up reviews after the initial one:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automatic">
    **Review every new push**
    
    Kody will automatically run a new review whenever changes are pushed to the PR. This ensures continuous feedback on all code changes.
    
    Best for:
    - Active development with frequent updates
    - Teams that want immediate feedback on changes
    - Critical projects requiring constant oversight
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Auto-pause">
    **Pause if a push burst is detected**
    
    Kody automatically pauses reviews when multiple pushes happen within a short time window, preventing review spam during active development.
    
    Configuration:
    - **Pushes to trigger pause**: Number of consecutive pushes (default: 3)
    - **Time window (minutes)**: Time frame to detect push bursts (default: 15)
    
    Best for:
    - Development workflows with frequent commits
    - Avoiding review noise during active coding sessions
    - Teams that want smart review timing
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual">
    **Only run when you comment @kody start-review**
    
    Kody will only perform follow-up reviews when explicitly requested via comment. The initial review still happens automatically when the PR is opened.
    
    Best for:
    - Teams that prefer controlled review timing
    - Projects with infrequent updates
    - Workflows where manual review triggers are preferred
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  The initial review when a PR is opened always happens automatically when Automated Code Review is enabled, regardless of the cadence setting.
</Note>

### PR Workflow
#### Auto-approve PRs
When enabled, Kody automatically approves PRs with no issues found.

When to use:
- Small, low-risk changes (like docs or tests)
- Teams with high trust and good test coverage
- Projects with strong CI/CD pipelines

Platform support:
- ✅ GitHub: Shows as approved review
- ✅ GitLab: Sets as approved
- ✅ Bitbucket: Adds approval

#### Request Changes
When enabled, Kody requests changes when finding **critical issues.**

When to use:
- Enforcing security standards
- Preventing performance issues
- Maintaining code quality gates

Platform support:
- ✅ GitHub: Shows as "Changes Requested" review
- ❌ GitLab: Not available yet
- ✅ Bitbucket: Adds needs work status

### Skip Conditions
- Ignored Files: Use glob patterns (e.g., `**/*.js`), one per line
- Ignored Titles: Skip PRs with specific keywords (case-insensitive, max 100 chars)

## Analysis Types

### Code Quality
- Security: SQL injection, XSS, security threats
- Performance: Caching, query optimization, speed improvements
- Error Handling: Exception management, error messages
- Potential Issues: Null pointers, resource leaks, infinite loops

### Code Structure
- Refactoring: Code organization, function size, duplication
- Maintainability: Future-proof code patterns
- Code Style: Consistent formatting and standards
- Documentation: Clear comments and API docs
- Kody Rules: Custom rule enforcement

## Automated Code Review

If active, Kody will auto-review PRs when opened. If not, Kody only will trigger with `@kody start-review`.

## PR Workflow

### Auto-approve PRs when no issues found

When active, Kody will auto-approve PRs when no issues are found.

### Request Changes when critical issues detected

When active, Kody will request changes when critical issues are detected.

## Analysis Types

- **Security**: Detects and prevents vulnerabilities in the code. For example, it can identify and suggest fixes for SQL injection, XSS, and other security threats.
- **Performance**: Optimizes the code for speed and efficiency. For example, it can suggest using caching, reducing database queries, and optimizing loops.
- **Error Handling**: Improves the way the code handles exceptions. For example, it can suggest using try-catch blocks, logging errors, and providing meaningful error messages.
- **Refactoring**: Enhances the structure of the code. For example, it can suggest breaking down large functions into smaller ones, removing duplicate code, and improving naming conventions.
- **Maintainability**: Ensures the code is easy to maintain and understand. For example, it can suggest adding comments, following coding standards, and using design patterns.
- **Code Style**: Enforces consistent coding standards. For example, it can suggest using a consistent indentation style, following naming conventions, and using a consistent variable declaration style.
- **Documentation**: Encourages clear and meaningful comments. For example, it can suggest adding comments to explain complex code, documenting public APIs, and providing examples of usage.
- **Kody Rules**: Allows for the enforcement of custom rules. For example, it can be configured to enforce specific coding standards, naming conventions, or architectural rules.
- **Potential Issues**: Helps prevent bugs and issues. For example, it can detect and suggest fixes for potential null pointer exceptions, resource leaks, and infinite loops.

## Ignored Files

Skip specific files from review:

- Use glob patterns (e.g., `**/*.js`)
- One pattern per line
- Default ignores: `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, `.env`

## Ignore Title Keywords

Skip review for PRs with specific titles (case-insensitive, max 100 chars per keyword)
