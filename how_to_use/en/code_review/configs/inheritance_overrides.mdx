description: "How Global → Repository → Directory settings inherit, override, and propagate."

## Overview

Kodus configurations work across three levels: **Global**, **Repository**, and **Directory**.

<Note>
The most specific level wins: Directory > Repository > Global
</Note>

```
Global
 ├─ Repository A
 │   ├─ Directory A1
 │   └─ Directory A2
 └─ Repository B
```

## How It Works

Fields inherit from the parent level by default. When you change a field at Global, all repositories and directories without an override update automatically.

<Info>
Overrides are per field. You can override one field and inherit everything else.
</Info>

Once overridden, a field stops following the parent and uses its local value instead.

## Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Global change propagates">
    You change **Severity thresholds** at Global.
    
    All repositories and directories without an override update automatically. Overridden ones stay unchanged.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Repository override">
    In Repository X, you override **Review start message**.
    
    Directories within Repository X now inherit from Repository X (unless they have their own override).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Return to inheritance">
    In Repository Y, you remove the override for **Active categories**.
    
    The field follows Global again and receives future Global changes.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

- Start at Global with strong defaults
- Only override when you have a specific need for that repo/directory

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="If I change something at Global, will it break my local adjustments?">
    No. Local overrides stay unchanged.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I override just one field and inherit the rest?">
    Yes. Overrides are per field.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does a Directory inherit from Repository or Global?">
    From Repository first. If Repository has no override for that field, it inherits from Global.
