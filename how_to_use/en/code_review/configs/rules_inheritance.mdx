## Overview

By default, Kody Rules are inherited down the hierarchy:

**Global → Repository → Directory**

The effective rule set at each level is:
- Rules defined at that level, plus
- Rules inherited from the parent level,
- Minus any rules explicitly excluded at that level.

## Default behavior

- Global rules apply to all repositories and directories by default.
- Repository rules inherit all Global rules, plus any rules defined specifically for that repository.
- Directory rules inherit all rules from their repository, plus any rules defined specifically for that directory.

No action is required to enable inheritance — it is automatic.

## Breaking inheritance

There are two ways to stop a rule from being inherited:

### 1) Mark a rule as non‑inheritable (at creation time)

When creating a rule at any level (Global, Repository, or Directory), you can mark it as “non‑inheritable.”

Effect:
- The rule applies only at the level where it was created.
- It does not appear in child levels.

Use this when a rule is intentionally specific to a particular scope and should not flow down the hierarchy.

### 2) Exclude a parent rule from a child level

From a child configuration (Repository or Directory), you can explicitly exclude a rule that would otherwise be inherited from the parent.

Effect:
- The rule is not applied at that exact child level.
- The exclusion does not cascade further — grandchildren still see the parent’s rule unless they also exclude it (or the rule was created as non‑inheritable).

Use this to fine‑tune behavior for a specific repository or directory without affecting other children.

## Examples

### Excluding at the repository level

Suppose a Global rule “Require tests for new endpoints” exists. In repository “shop”, you exclude this rule at the repository level.

Result:
- At the repository level, the rule no longer applies.
- If you have a configured directory inside the same repository (e.g., `apps/api`), that directory still inherits the Global rule and will apply it — unless you also exclude it at the directory level, or the original Global rule was created as non‑inheritable.

### Creating a non‑inheritable Global rule

You create a Global rule and mark it as non‑inheritable.

Result:
- The rule applies only at the Global level.
- Repositories and directories do not inherit it.

## Practical tips

- Keep foundational rules at the Global level so all repos benefit by default.
- Use non‑inheritable rules for highly specific contexts that shouldn’t affect children.
- Use child‑level exclusions to make targeted exceptions without impacting other repos or directories.
