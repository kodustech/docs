## Suggestion Limit

### Limitation Type

- By PR (default): Max suggestions in entire pull request
- By File: Max suggestions per file

### Maximum Suggestions

Set how many suggestions Kody can make:

- Minimum: 6 suggestions
- Default: 10 suggestions
- Set to 0 for unlimited

Pro tip: Start with 10 and adjust based on your team's feedback. Too many suggestions can be overwhelming, too few might miss important issues.

## Severity Levels

### Minimum Severity

Choose which issues Kody will report:

- Low/All: Style issues, minor improvements
- Medium: Common best practices, potential bugs
- High: Significant issues, definite bugs
- Critical: Security issues, major problems

## Suggestion Grouping

### Unified Comments (default)

Combines similar issues into one comment, showing all affected files and lines. Great for:

- Large PRs with repeated issues
- Keeping discussions focused
- Reducing notification noise

### Individual Comments

<img src="https://app.kodus.io/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fminimal_grouping.png&w=1080&q=75" alt="Individual Comments" />
Separate comment for each issue. Better when:

- You need direct links to each location
- Team prefers focused, line-specific discussions
