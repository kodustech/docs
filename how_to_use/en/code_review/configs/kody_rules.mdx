## How to use Kody Rules

You can use Kody Rules in two ways:

### Create Custom Rules

Define rules based on your team's exact needs. Kody Rules can be applied at two different levels:

#### File-Level Rules
Analyze individual files to catch issues within specific code files:

- Rule name: Clearly define the rule purpose.
- File Paths: Limit rules to specific files or directories using glob patterns.
- Severity: Set to Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
- Detailed Instructions: Clearly state what's expected and why.

**Example:**

- Rule: "Avoid equality operators (==, !=) in loop termination conditions."
- Path: src/**/*.ts
- Severity: Critical
- Instructions: "Using equality operators (== or !=) can cause infinite loops if exact values aren't matched."

#### Pull Request-Level Rules
Analyze the entire Pull Request for cross-file validation and PR-specific requirements:

The creation process is identical to file-level rules, but you must select the "Pull-request" scope. PR-level rules receive the complete list of changed files and PR information (title, description), enabling analysis of the overall context.

**Examples:**
- Every service file must have a corresponding test file
- PR description must be complete, clearly stating what was added or removed
- When a new route is created in a controller, it must be registered in routes.json

### Import from Rules Library

Leverage proven best practices instantly:

- Navigate to Discovery Rules in your Kodus dashboard.
- Filter rules by severity, language, or tags.
- Import and activate rules with a single click.

**Examples:**

- Security: "Disallow use of insecure MD5 hashing."
- Maintainability: "Limit React components to less than 150 lines."

## Integration with IDE Rules

Kody Rules work seamlessly with your existing IDE configurations through [IDE Rules Sync](/how_to_use/en/code_review/configs/ide_rules_sync). This feature automatically imports rules from popular AI coding assistants like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude, providing a comprehensive foundation for your custom Kody Rules.

<Tip>
Start with IDE Rules Sync to import your existing standards, then create custom Kody Rules for specific enforcement and team requirements.
