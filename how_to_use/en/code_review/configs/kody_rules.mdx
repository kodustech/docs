## How to use Kody Rules

You can use Kody Rules in two ways:

### Create Custom Rules

Define rules based on your team's exact needs. Kody Rules can be applied at two different levels:

#### File-Level Rules

Analyze individual files to catch issues within specific code files.

**Available Context:**
- **File diff**: The specific changes made to the individual file being analyzed

**How to Configure:**
- **Rule name**: Clearly define the rule purpose
- **File Paths**: Limit rules to specific files or directories using glob patterns
- **Severity**: Set to Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Detailed Instructions**: Clearly state what's expected and why

**Configuration Example:**

üìã **Rule**: "Avoid equality operators (==, !=) in loop termination conditions."

üìÅ **Path**: `src/**/*.ts`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Severity**: Critical

üìù **Instructions**: "Using equality operators (== or !=) can cause infinite loops if exact values aren't matched."

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```typescript
// Risk of infinite loop if increment is not exactly 1
for (let i = 0; i != 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i); // Will print 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14... forever
}

// Risk if array is modified during iteration
let items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i != items.length; i++) {
  if (items[i] === 3) {
    items.push(6); // Modifies length, can cause infinite loop
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ Good Example:**
```typescript
// Safe: loop will always terminate
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i); // Will print 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and stop
}

// Safe even if array is modified
let items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  if (items[i] === 3) {
    items.push(6); // Loop will still terminate safely
  }
}
```

#### Pull Request-Level Rules

Analyze the entire Pull Request for cross-file validation and PR-specific requirements.

**Available Context:**
- **PR diff**: Complete diff of all changes across the entire Pull Request
- **PR title**: The title of the Pull Request
- **PR description**: The description/body of the Pull Request
- **PR statistics**: Comprehensive metrics including total additions, deletions, files changed, and total lines modified

**How to Configure:**

The creation process is identical to file-level rules, but you must select the "Pull-request" scope. This broader context enables analysis of cross-file dependencies and overall PR quality.

**Examples:**
- Every service file must have a corresponding test file
- PR description must be complete, clearly stating what was added or removed
- When a new route is created in a controller, it must be registered in routes.json

### Import from Rules Library

Leverage proven best practices instantly:

- Navigate to Discovery Rules in your Kodus dashboard.
- Filter rules by severity, language, or tags.
- Import and activate rules with a single click.

**Examples:**

- Security: "Disallow use of insecure MD5 hashing."
- Maintainability: "Limit React components to less than 150 lines."
