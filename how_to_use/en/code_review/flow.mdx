## Overview

Kody reviews your PRs automatically or on demand, adds clear suggestions, and helps your team decide when to merge. Below is the simple, user-facing view of how it works.

Reference: <a href="https://www.figma.com/board/ZZJcIJMJWGuyzRGMh3w5di/Kodus-Code-Review-Flow?node-id=4-274" target="_blank">Figma board</a>

## When Kody Runs

- PR opened
- New commit pushed to the PR (depending on cadence)
- Manual trigger via comment: `@kody start-review`

## When Kody Skips

- No new commits since the last run
- Only merge commits with no effective changes
- All changed files ignored by configured patterns
- PR exceeds the configured file limit
- Invalid or missing configuration

## What Kody Does

- Resolves which settings apply (global → repo → directory) and validates them
- Collects the relevant diffs and context for this PR
- Runs PR-level checks (e.g., custom rules and cross-file analysis when enabled)
- Reviews changed files with focus on the diff
- Filters and prioritizes suggestions to reduce noise (relevance, severity, dedupe, safeguards)
- Posts inline comments and, when applicable, a PR-level summary
- Optionally approves or requests changes if those policies are enabled
- Remembers the last analyzed commit to keep follow-ups incremental

## What You Get

- Inline comments with concrete suggestions
- Optional PR-level summary with highlights
- Optional status: approved or changes requested (if enabled)

## Status Reactions

Kody uses emoji reactions to show the live status of your code review directly in your Git provider. No guessing whether she’s working, done, or ran into a problem. She always replaces the previous emoji with the latest status (for example: 🚀 → 🎉, 👀, 👎 or 😕).

<Note>
  Supported on GitHub and GitLab. Azure DevOps and Bitbucket do not support
  reactions yet.
</Note>

### What each emoji means

- 🚀 Processing — Kody is working on your code:
  - Analyzing files
  - Checking rules and policies
  - Generating suggestions
- 🎉 Completed — Review finished:
  - All comments posted
  - Analysis complete
  - You can review the suggestions
- 👀 Skipped — Review was skipped. Common reasons include:
  - No new commits since the last run
  - Only merge commits detected
  - PR/MR exceeds the configured file limit
  - No relevant files to review (ignored patterns)
  - Branch not configured for review
  - PR/MR in draft mode (if configured to skip drafts)
- 👎 No license — The user is not licensed:
  - Kody cannot run without a valid license
  - Ensure the user that opened the PR/MR has a license assigned
  - Optionally, enable [Auto License Assignment](/how_to_use/en/auto_license_assignment) to assign licenses automatically
- 😕 Error — Something went wrong:
  - Temporary technical issue during the review
  - Try again; join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/TFZBRk9fT6) if it persists

### Where reactions appear

- Automatic review (PR opened or new commit): reaction on the PR/MR description (top of the thread)
- Manual review (comment `@kody start-review`): reaction on your comment where you invoked Kody

### Example scenarios

- New PR (automatic): 🚀 while running → 🎉 when finished
- Manual command: 🚀 on your comment → 🎉 when finished
- No changes since last run: 👀 reaction
- Unlicensed user: 👎 reaction
- Temporary issue: 😕 reaction

### FAQs

**I don't see reactions**

- GitHub/GitLab: ✅ | Azure DevOps/Bitbucket: ❌ (not supported yet)

**Why did the emoji change?**

- Normal—Kody replaces previous status (🚀 → 🎉/👀/😕)

**I saw 👀 but wanted a review**

- Likely skipped: no new commits, merge-only, ignored files, or file limit
- Fix: comment `@kody start-review`

**I saw 👎**

- The user that opened the PR/MR is not licensed
- Fix: assign a license or enable [Auto License Assignment](/how_to_use/en/auto_license_assignment)

**I saw 😕**

- Retry with `@kody start-review`. If persists, check [Troubleshooting](/how_to_use/en/code_review/troubleshooting) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/TFZBRk9fT6)

## Settings That Matter

- Automated vs manual reviews and follow-up cadence
- Ignore patterns and base branches in scope
- Custom rules and cross-file analysis
- Suggestion controls: severity filter, grouping, and max suggestions
- File limits and timeouts

## Tips

- Keep PRs small—large diffs reduce review quality
- Link specs/tickets in PR description
- Re-run with `@kody start-review` after addressing feedback
