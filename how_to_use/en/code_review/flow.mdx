## Overview

Kody reviews your PRs automatically or on demand, adds clear suggestions, and helps your team decide when to merge. Below is the simple, user-facing view of how it works.

## When Kody Runs

- PR opened
- New commit pushed to the PR (depending on cadence)
- Manual trigger via comment: `@kody start-review`

## When Kody Skips

- No new commits since the last run
- Only merge commits with no effective changes
- All changed files ignored by configured patterns
- PR exceeds the configured file limit
- Invalid or missing configuration

## What Kody Does

- Resolves which settings apply (global → repo → directory) and validates them
- Collects the relevant diffs and context for this PR
- Runs PR-level checks (e.g., custom rules and cross-file analysis when enabled)
- Reviews changed files with focus on the diff
- Filters and prioritizes suggestions to reduce noise (relevance, severity, dedupe, safeguards)
- Posts inline comments and, when applicable, a PR-level summary
- Optionally approves or requests changes if those policies are enabled
- Remembers the last analyzed commit to keep follow-ups incremental

## What You Get

- Inline comments with concrete suggestions
- Optional PR-level summary with highlights
- Optional status: approved or changes requested (if enabled)

## Settings That Matter

- Automated vs manual reviews and follow-up cadence
- Ignore patterns and base branches in scope
- Custom rules and cross-file analysis
- Suggestion controls: severity filter, grouping, and max suggestions
- File limits and timeouts

## Tips

- Keep PRs small and focused; large diffs reduce review quality
- Add context (spec/ticket links) in the PR description
- After addressing feedback, push changes or trigger `@kody start-review` to re-run
