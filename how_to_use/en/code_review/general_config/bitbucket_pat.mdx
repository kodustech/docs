title: "Bitbucket API Token"
---

## Introduction

To enable Kody to perform automatic code reviews on Bitbucket Cloud, you need to generate an **API Token**. This token allows Kody to access your repositories, pull requests, webhooks, issues, pipelines etc., with the specific permissions listed below.

---

## Generating the API Token in Bitbucket

1. Log in to Bitbucket and click the **Settings** gear icon in the upper-right corner.  
2. In your Atlassian account area, go to **Personal settings → Security**.  
3. Click **Create and manage API tokens**.  
4. Click **Create API token with scopes**.  
5. Give the token a name (for example `kody_code_review`) and set an expiration date (if applicable).  
6. If prompted, select “Bitbucket” as the application.  
7. Select all the required scopes (see below).  
8. Review your choices, then click **Create token**.  
9. **Copy** the token immediately and store it securely — after creation you will not be able to view it again.

## Required Scopes for Kody

The token must include **all** of the following scopes for full functionality with Kody:

| Scope | Purpose / What it Enables |
|---|---|
| `read:user:bitbucket` | Read basic user or account information. |
| `read:workspace:bitbucket` | Read information about the workspace (projects, members, repositories). |
| `read:project:bitbucket` | Read metadata about projects. |
| `read:repository:bitbucket` | Read code, branches, source files in repositories. |
| `write:repository:bitbucket` | Modify repository contents where needed (comments, file updates, etc.). |
| `admin:repository:bitbucket` | Administrative operations on repository: manage webhooks, permissions, repository settings. |
| `read:pullrequest:bitbucket` | View pull requests, their statuses, comments. |
| `write:pullrequest:bitbucket` | Create or modify pull request comments; approve, decline or merge PRs. |
| `read:issue:bitbucket` | Read issue tracker information. |
| `read:webhook:bitbucket` | View existing webhooks and their settings. |
| `write:webhook:bitbucket` | Create or update webhooks. |
| `read:pipeline:bitbucket` | Read status/logs of pipelines associated with repositories or PRs. |

> ⚠️ Ensure you grant only these necessary permissions; avoid granting more than required to reduce security risk.

## Adding the Token to Kody

- Once the token is generated with all the required scopes, paste it into the **Kody integration / automation setup screen** when enabling the Bitbucket integration.  
- Make sure the token has `admin:repository:bitbucket` (or equivalent) if Kody needs to configure webhooks or listen for pull request events.

## Important Notes

- The token will be **displayed only once** upon creation. Save it securely, because you will **not** be able to view it again.  
- Set an **expiry date** if possible, to limit the token’s lifetime.  
- If the token is ever compromised, revoke it immediately and create a new one.  
- Periodically audit the tokens and their scopes to confirm they are still necessary and valid.  
- Check whether your Bitbucket plan / account allows all the above scopes; some scopes (project, workspace, admin) may depend on subscription / permissions.
