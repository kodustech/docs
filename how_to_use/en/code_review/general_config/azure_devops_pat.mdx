title: "Azure DevOps PAT Token"
---

## Introduction to the PAT

To enable Kody to perform automatic Code Reviews, you need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in Azure DevOps. This token allows Kody to securely access your repositories and conduct code analysis in a controlled way.

## Generating the PAT (Personal Access Token)

You can access the PAT settings directly using this link: [Azure DevOps PATs](https://dev.azure.com/).

Follow these steps to set up the token correctly:

1. **Access Azure DevOps and go to your security settings:**

   - Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) and sign in.
   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner.
   - Select **"Security"** from the dropdown.

2. **Create a new PAT:**

   - Under the **Personal Access Tokens** section, click on **"New Token"**.

3. **Set up the new token with the following specifications:**

   - **Name:** Choose an easily identifiable name, such as `kody_code_review`.
   - **Organization:** Select your target organization.
   - **Expiration:** Choose an appropriate expiration time (e.g., 90 or 180 days).
   - **Scopes:** Select the following permissions:

     - **Analytics:** Read
     - **Code:** Read & Write
     - **Graph:** Read
     - **Identities and Groups:** Read
     - **Project and Team:** Read
     - **User Profile:** Read

4. **Click Create.**

Copy the generated token and store it securely, as youâ€™ll need it to configure Kody.

<Note>
  Write access to Code is required for Kody to post comments and manage pull request feedback.

## Adding the Token to Kody

After generating the token, paste it into the Kody automation setup screen. The configuration modal will open automatically when you attempt to enable the automation.
