## How It Works

Whenever a team member opens a pull request, Kody performs a Code Review directly in your code management tool, such as GitHub or GitLab. Kody analyzes the code, provides detailed feedback, and highlights potential issues, just as a human reviewer would. This ensures code quality and speeds up the review process.

Additionally, you can use the command `@kody start-review` directly in Git to have Kody initiate a code review on any pull request. This command bypasses branch and naming configurations, so Kody will review any PR where the command is used.

### Severity Levels

#### Low Level

Minor enhancements that would improve code quality. These represent small optimizations, style improvements, or subtle refinements that would incrementally better the codebase.

#### Medium Level

Moderate improvements recommended but not immediately critical. These suggestions focus on enhancing code quality, following best practices, and preventing future technical debt.

#### High Level

Significant issues that should be addressed in the near term. These represent important improvements needed in code quality, potential risks, or substantial technical improvements that would notably enhance the codebase.

#### Critical Level

Issues that require immediate attention and could severely impact system stability, security, or functionality. These problems typically represent high-risk scenarios that could lead to system failures, vulnerabilities, or significant technical debt.
