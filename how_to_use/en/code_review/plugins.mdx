## Overview

Plugins let you bring external business context directly into Kody's review workflow. They extend Kody's understanding with data from tools such as Jira, so feedback and actions stay aligned with your team's processes.

## What Plugins Are

Plugins are Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers curated by Kodus. Each plugin exposes specific capabilities—like fetching tasks or checking specs—that Kody can use while collaborating with you on pull requests.

## Kodus MCP

Every workspace ships with the Kodus MCP already connected. It aggregates secure adapters for every supported Git provider—GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps—so you never need to install separate code-manipulation plugins.

Beyond source control, the Kodus MCP unlocks first-party automations:

- Manage Kody rules directly from a review thread (create, edit, or remove).
- Open Kody issues manually when you need a custom follow-up outside of the automated flow.

## Using Plugins in Suggestions

Interact with a plugin inside a code review suggestion by explicitly mentioning Kody in your comment. Once invoked, Kody calls the relevant plugin and replies in the same thread.

### Example prompts

- `@kody, update this kody rule to ignore test files`
- `@kody, move this task https://jira.com/task-123 to DONE`

These prompts keep the discussion in context and let teammates follow the full conversation inside the PR.

## Validating Business Logic

Use the `@kody -v business-logic` command when you want Kody to compare a pull request against a specification. Provide the spec content inline or share a link:

- `@kody -v business-logic https://jira.com/task-123`

Kody will fetch the referenced specification through the plugin and confirm whether the implementation matches the documented behavior.

## Controlling Access

Kody only sees the tools you enable for each workspace. Install the plugins that matter to your workflow and keep everything else private.

## Tips

- Mention Kody only once per request so the correct plugin runs without duplication.
- Keep links accessible to your workspace; Kody needs permission to reach the target resource through the plugin.
- Review the plugin catalog periodically—new integrations are added as Kodus curates additional MCP servers.
