## Overview

Business Logic Validation lets you confirm that a pull request implements the expected behaviour described in a spec, document, or ticket. Kody analyzes the PR diff, brings in the referenced business context, and flags mismatches before you merge.

## Prerequisites
- Any link you share (Jira, Slack, Google Docs, etc.) must be reachable through the plugins installed in your workspace.
- If you provide the spec inline, keep it concise and structured so Kody can understand the requirements.

## Running the Command

1. Open the main PR comment box (outside of inline code suggestions).
2. Mention Kody and add the validation command: `@kody -v business-logic ...`.
3. Provide the spec content inline or paste a link that Kody can fetch via the available plugins.
4. Submit the comment and wait for Kody's response in the same thread.

The command only triggers from the main conversation box; replies inside inline suggestions are ignored.

You can re-run the validation at any time—simply post the command again in a new comment. Follow-ups must be a fresh command; replying directly to Kody's message in the Git UI is not supported.

## Examples

- Jira ticket: `@kody -v business-logic https://kodustech.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/KC/boards/2?selectedIssue=KC-1292`
- Inline spec snippet: `@kody -v business-logic Rule XYZ — orders above $500 must issue cashback credits.`
- Slack conversation: `@kody -v business-logic https://kodustech.slack.com/archives/C070E5E97DE/p1727814000000000`
- Google Doc: `@kody -v business-logic https://docs.google.com/document/d/1234567890/edit`

## What Kody Does

- Fetches the latest diff for the pull request.
- Retrieves the referenced specification through the appropriate plugin or uses the inline text you supplied.
- Compares implementation details against the documented expectations.
- Responds in the thread with confirmations or highlights of any discrepancies that require attention.

If Kody cannot reach the resource or lacks permissions, it will call that out so you can adjust access or provide the information another way.

## Tips

- Break large specs into sections and validate them individually to keep feedback focused.
- When sharing private links, double-check that the required plugin (e.g., Jira, Slack, Google Drive) is installed and authorized for your workspace.
- After addressing findings, rerun the command to confirm the PR now aligns with the business rules.
