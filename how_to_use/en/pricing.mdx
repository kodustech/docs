## How Pricing Works

Our pricing is per developer who actively creates pull requests in your team.
This ensures flexibility and scalability as your team evolves:

- **Pay Per Active Developer:** Only pay for developers who are actively contributing with pull requests.
- **Adjustable at Any Time:** Update the number of active developers anytime through your account settings.

## Teams Pricing: BYOK vs. Managed

Choose the model that best fits your team's needs:

### BYOK Mode - $10/dev/month

Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) gives you maximum flexibility and control:

- **You manage your own API keys** from any LLM provider
- **Choose the best model** for your use case - whether that's the most advanced or the most cost-effective
- **Full transparency** - you see exactly what you're spending on tokens
- **No token limits** - use as much as you need based on your provider's limits
- Perfect for teams that want to optimize costs or use cutting-edge models

### Managed Mode - $30/dev/month

Let Kodus handle everything for you with the best cost-benefit ratio:

- **We manage all tokens** - no need to set up API keys
- **Optimized for value** - we intelligently select models and optimize usage to fit within $20/dev/month in tokens, ensuring you get the best quality for the cost
- **Fixed cost guarantee** - $30/dev/month total, no surprises
- **Automatic optimization** - we balance quality and cost, similar to Cursor's auto mode
- **Zero configuration** - just sign up and start reviewing
- Perfect for teams that want maximum value without the complexity of managing API keys

Both modes include all Teams features - the only difference is how you handle API keys and token costs.

## Unlimited Pull Requests

Your team can submit as many pull requests as they want each weekâ€”there's no limit on PRs across all plans. The only restriction comes from the API limits of your Git provider and for very large repositories. We do not allow reviewing pull requests with more than 200 files.

## Support for Non-Profits and Open Source

2. Share your organization name, website, and a brief description of your work in the community

4. For open-source: Share links to your public repositories
