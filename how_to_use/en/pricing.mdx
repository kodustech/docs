## How Pricing Works

Our pricing is per developer who actively creates pull requests in your team.
This ensures flexibility and scalability as your team evolves:

- **Pay Per Active Developer:** Only pay for developers who are actively contributing with pull requests.
- **Adjustable at Any Time:** Update the number of active developers anytime through your account settings.

## Pricing Tiers

We offer both monthly and annual billing options:

- **Monthly Plan:** $ 12 per developer per month.
- **Annual Plan:** $9 per developer per month (billed annually).
- **Special Discount:** Teams based in Brazil receive additional discounts.

## Unlimited Pull Requests

Your team can submit as many pull requests as they want each weekâ€”there's no limit on PRs. The only restriction comes from the API limits of your Git provider and for very large repositories. We do not allow reviewing pull requests with more than 200 files.

## Support for Non-Profits and Open Source

## Payments and Billing
