## What is Cockpit Analytics

Cockpit Analytics provides comprehensive insights into your engineering team's performance through key metrics that measure productivity, code quality, and delivery efficiency. These metrics help you identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.

<Warning>
  Cockpit is available exclusively on the **Teams plan (cloud)**. Self-hosted Community installations do not include Cockpit features.

## How Developer Matching Works
