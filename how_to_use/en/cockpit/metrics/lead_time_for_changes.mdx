## What is PR Cycle Time

PR Cycle Time measures the total time from when a developer first commits code until that code is successfully merged into the default branch. This metric represents the end-to-end delivery speed of your development process.

## How We Calculate It

We automatically track the time between your first commit and when that code gets merged into the default branch (main/master). Since merges to main typically represent when code is ready for production, this gives us a good measure of your development cycle time.

**What We Track:**
- Time from first commit to PR merge
- The complete development cycle
- How long code takes to be integrated

**What We Don't Count:**
- Time spent planning or designing (before first commit)
- Time after merge (deployment, user adoption, etc.)
- Failed or abandoned changes

**How It's Calculated:**
```
PR Cycle Time = (PR Merge Time) - (First Commit Time)
```

We use the 75th percentile (P75) to show you the typical cycle time, filtering out unusually long outliers that could skew your understanding of normal performance.

## Why It Matters

PR Cycle Time is a critical metric that measures your team's ability to complete development work efficiently. High cycle times may indicate large batch sizes, lengthy review processes, or bottlenecks in the development workflow.


## How to Improve

- Break large changes into smaller PRs (200-400 lines)
- Set clear review expectations and guidelines
- Use automated checks to catch issues pre-review
- Distribute review workload across the team
- Get early feedback during development
- Use consistent branching strategy
