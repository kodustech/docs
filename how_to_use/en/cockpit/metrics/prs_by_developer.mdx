## What is PRs by Developer

PRs by Developer measures the number of **closed** Pull Requests completed by each team member, grouped by week. This metric focuses on actual results and completed work, giving you insights into individual developer productivity and team workload distribution.

## How We Calculate It

We automatically track every closed Pull Request and group them by developer and week, starting from Monday. This gives you a clear view of who is completing work and when.

**What We Track:**
- **Closed PRs**: Every PR that has been completed (merged or closed)
- **Developer Attribution**: Who authored each completed PR
- **Weekly Aggregation**: Grouped by week starting Monday
- **Completion Count**: Number of PRs finished per developer per week

**What We Don't Count:**
- Open or draft PRs
- PRs without a valid close date
- Incomplete or abandoned work

**How It's Calculated:**
```
Weekly PRs per Developer = COUNT(closed PRs) per developer per week
```

We group data by week starting Monday to give you consistent weekly insights and identify trends over time.

## Why It Matters

Understanding PR completion by developer helps you:

- **Measure Individual Output**: See who is completing the most work
- **Identify Productivity Patterns**: Understand weekly rhythms and trends
- **Balance Workload**: Distribute work more evenly across the team
- **Track Team Performance**: Monitor overall team velocity and output

### Impact on Team Management

- **Resource Allocation**: Better distribute work based on individual capacity
- **Performance Recognition**: Acknowledge high performers and their contributions
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find where work gets stuck or delayed
- **Team Planning**: Set realistic expectations for project timelines

### Team Distribution
- **Balanced**: Work distributed evenly across team members
- **Concentrated**: Few developers handling most of the work
- **Fragmented**: Work spread too thinly across many developers

## How to Improve

### Increase Individual Output
- **Clear Goals**: Set specific, achievable targets for each developer
- **Skill Development**: Provide training on areas that slow them down
- **Tool Optimization**: Ensure developers have the right tools and access
- **Reduced Blockers**: Remove obstacles that prevent work completion

### Improve Team Balance
- **Work Distribution**: Spread work more evenly across the team
- **Cross-training**: Help developers work on different areas
- **Pair Programming**: Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing
- **Mentorship**: Senior developers help junior team members

### Optimize Workflow
- **Clear Processes**: Define how work flows through the team
- **Automation**: Reduce manual, repetitive tasks
- **Communication**: Improve team coordination and information sharing
- **Review Efficiency**: Streamline the code review process

## Key Differences from Developer Activity

| **Aspect** | **Developer Activity** | **PRs by Developer** |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **PR Status** | ❌ No filtering | ✅ `status = 'closed'` |
| **Date Basis** | **Creation** date | **Completion** date |
| **Aggregation** | By **specific date** | By **week** |
| **Focus** | Creation activity | Completed results |

## Common Patterns

### High Output Developers
- **Characteristics**: Consistently complete many PRs per week
- **Benefits**: Drive team velocity, set performance standards
- **Risks**: Potential burnout, knowledge silos
- **Management**: Ensure sustainable pace, share knowledge

### Low Output Developers
- **Characteristics**: Complete fewer PRs per week
- **Possible Causes**: Learning curve, complex tasks, external factors
- **Support**: Provide mentoring, simplify tasks, check for blockers
- **Goals**: Set incremental improvement targets

## Context Considerations
- **PR Size**: A developer with fewer but larger PRs may be equally productive
- **Complexity**: Some work naturally takes longer to complete
- **Team Role**: Different roles may have different PR patterns
- **Project Phase**: Output varies during different development phases
