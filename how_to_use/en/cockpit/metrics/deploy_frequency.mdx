## What is Deploy Frequency

Deploy Frequency measures how many times your team successfully deploys code to production within a given time period. This metric is a key indicator of your team's ability to deliver value quickly and maintain a smooth delivery pipeline.

## How We Calculate It

We automatically track every time your team merges code into the main branch (or default branch). Since merges to main typically trigger deployments, this gives us a good measure of how frequently your team delivers code to production.

**What We Track:**
- Every merge to your main/default branch
- The time period you select (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Successful code integrations

**How It's Calculated:**
```
Deploy Frequency = (Number of Merges to Main) รท (Time Period in Weeks)
```

For example, if you merge 12 times to main in a 4-week period, your deploy frequency is 3 merges per week.

**Note**: We measure merges to main because they typically represent when code is ready for production deployment. If your team has a different workflow (like deploying from feature branches), this metric may need interpretation.

## Why It Matters

Frequent deployments ensure new features and bug fixes reach users quickly, boosting customer satisfaction and competitiveness. They also reduce risks and facilitate issue resolution.

## How to Improve

### Short-term Actions
- **Automate Deployments**: Implement CI/CD pipelines
- **Reduce PR Size**: Break large changes into smaller, focused PRs
- **Streamline Reviews**: Set clear review guidelines and expectations

### Long-term Strategies
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Make deployments repeatable and reliable
- **Feature Flags**: Deploy code without immediately exposing features
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive observability to catch issues early

## Common Challenges

- **Fear of Breaking Changes**: Implement proper testing and rollback strategies
- **Manual Processes**: Automate repetitive deployment tasks
- **Large Batch Sizes**: Encourage smaller, more frequent changes
- **Review Bottlenecks**: Streamline the code review process
