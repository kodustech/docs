## What is Deploy Frequency

Deploy Frequency measures how many times your team successfully deploys code to production within a given time period. This metric is a key indicator of your team's ability to deliver value quickly and maintain a smooth delivery pipeline.

## How We Calculate It

We automatically track every time your team merges code into the main branch (or default branch). Since merges to main typically trigger deployments, this gives us a good measure of how frequently your team delivers code to production.

**What We Track:**
- Every merge to your main/default branch
- The time period you select (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Successful code integrations

**How It's Calculated:**
```
Deploy Frequency = (Number of Merges to Main) รท (Time Period in Weeks)
```

For example, if you merge 12 times to main in a 4-week period, your deploy frequency is 3 merges per week.

**Note**: We measure merges to main because they typically represent when code is ready for production deployment. If your team has a different workflow (like deploying from feature branches), this metric may need interpretation.

## Why It Matters

Frequent deployments ensure new features and bug fixes reach users quickly, boosting customer satisfaction and competitiveness. They also reduce risks and facilitate issue resolution.

## How to Improve

- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments
- Break large changes into smaller PRs
- Use feature flags to deploy without exposing features
- Make infrastructure as code for repeatable deployments
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and quick rollback
