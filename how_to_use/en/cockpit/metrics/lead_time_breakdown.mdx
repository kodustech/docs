## What is Lead Time Breakdown

Lead Time Breakdown gives you a detailed view of your development process by breaking down the total cycle time into three key phases: coding time, pickup time, and review time. This helps you identify exactly where bottlenecks occur in your workflow.

## How We Calculate It

We automatically track the time spent in each phase of your development process, from first commit to PR merge.

**What We Track:**
- **Coding Time**: Active development time (first commit to last commit)
- **Pickup Time**: Time between last commit and creating the PR
- **Review Time**: Time from PR creation to merge

**What We Don't Count:**
- Time before first commit (planning, design)
- Time after merge (deployment, etc.)
- Failed or abandoned PRs

**How It's Calculated:**
```
Coding Time = (Last Commit Time) - (First Commit Time)
Pickup Time = (PR Opened Time) - (Last Commit Time)  
Review Time = (PR Closed Time) - (PR Opened Time)
```

We use the 75th percentile (P75) for each phase to filter out outliers and show you typical performance.

## Why It Matters

Understanding where time is spent helps you optimize the right part of your process:

- **Coding Time**: Shows development efficiency
- **Pickup Time**: Reveals workflow bottlenecks
- **Review Time**: Indicates review process effectiveness

## How to Improve

### Reduce Coding Time
- **Clear Requirements**: Ensure developers understand what to build
- **Smaller Features**: Break large changes into manageable pieces
- **Pair Programming**: Collaborate to solve complex problems faster
- **Code Reuse**: Leverage existing patterns and components

### Reduce Pickup Time
- **Immediate PR Creation**: Create PRs right after finishing code
- **Workflow Automation**: Use tools to streamline PR creation
- **Clear Definition of Done**: Know exactly when code is ready
- **Reduce Context Switching**: Focus on completing one task at a time

### Reduce Review Time
- **Review Guidelines**: Set clear expectations for reviewers
- **Automated Checks**: Use tools to catch issues before review
- **Review Rotation**: Distribute review workload across the team
- **Quick Responses**: Respond promptly to review comments

## Common Bottlenecks

### Coding Time
- **Unclear Requirements**: Developers don't know what to build
- **Complex Features**: Changes that are too large or complex
- **Technical Debt**: Working around existing code issues
- **Dependencies**: Waiting for other components or services

### Pickup Time
- **Workflow Inefficiency**: Manual steps that slow down the process
- **Context Switching**: Moving between multiple tasks
- **Lack of Automation**: Manual PR creation and setup

### Review Time
- **Large PRs**: Changes that are too big to review quickly
- **Reviewer Availability**: Not enough people available to review
- **Unclear Changes**: PRs that are hard to understand
- **Review Backlog**: Too many PRs waiting for review
