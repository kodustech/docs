## What is Developer Activity

Developer Activity measures how productive your team members are over time, tracking commits, Pull Requests, and reviews on a weekly basis. This helps you understand individual performance, team workload distribution, and identify patterns in development activity.

## How We Calculate It

We automatically track each developer's activity throughout the week, measuring their contributions and engagement with the codebase.

**What We Track:**
- **PRs Created**: Number of PRs created by each developer

**How It's Calculated:**
```
Weekly Activity = COUNT(PRs Created) per developer per week
```

We aggregate data by week starting Monday to give you consistent weekly insights.

## Why It Matters

Understanding developer activity helps you:

- **Identify Top Performers**: Recognize your most productive team members
- **Balance Workload**: Distribute work more evenly across the team
- **Track Trends**: See how productivity changes over time
- **Improve Collaboration**: Understand team dynamics and patterns

### Impact on Team Performance

- **Resource Allocation**: Better distribute work based on capacity
- **Performance Recognition**: Acknowledge and reward high performers
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find where work gets stuck
- **Team Health**: Monitor for burnout or disengagement


## How to Improve

### Increase Individual Productivity
- **Clear Goals**: Set specific, achievable targets for each developer
- **Skill Development**: Provide training and learning opportunities
- **Tool Optimization**: Ensure developers have the right tools
- **Reduced Interruptions**: Minimize context switching and meetings

### Improve Team Balance
- **Work Distribution**: Spread work more evenly across the team
- **Cross-training**: Help developers work on different areas

### Optimize Workflow
- **Clear Processes**: Define how work flows through the team
- **Automation**: Reduce manual, repetitive tasks
- **Communication**: Improve team coordination and information sharing
- **Feedback Loops**: Regular check-ins and performance reviews

## Common Patterns
