## What is Developer Activity

Developer Activity measures how productive your team members are over time, tracking commits, Pull Requests, and reviews on a weekly basis. This helps you understand individual performance, team workload distribution, and identify patterns in development activity.

## How We Calculate It

We automatically track each developer's activity throughout the week, measuring their contributions and engagement with the codebase.

**What We Track:**
- **PRs Created**: Number of PRs created by each developer

**How It's Calculated:**
```
Weekly Activity = COUNT(PRs Created) per developer per week
```

We aggregate data by week starting Monday to give you consistent weekly insights.

## Why It Matters

Understanding developer activity helps you:

- **Identify Top Performers**: Recognize your most productive team members
- **Balance Workload**: Distribute work more evenly across the team
- **Track Trends**: See how productivity changes over time
- **Improve Collaboration**: Understand team dynamics and patterns

### Impact on Team Performance

- **Resource Allocation**: Better distribute work based on capacity
- **Performance Recognition**: Acknowledge and reward high performers
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find where work gets stuck
- **Team Health**: Monitor for burnout or disengagement


## How to Improve

- Set clear goals and specific targets for each developer
- Provide training and learning opportunities
- Spread work more evenly across the team
- Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Define clear processes for how work flows
