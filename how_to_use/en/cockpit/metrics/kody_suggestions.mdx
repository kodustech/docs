## What are Kody Suggestions

Kody Suggestions measures the effectiveness of AI-powered code suggestions generated by Kodus. This metric tracks how many suggestions are sent to developers and how many are actually implemented, providing insights into the value and adoption of AI-assisted development.

## How We Calculate It

We automatically track how many AI-powered suggestions Kody sends to your team and how many of those suggestions are actually implemented in your code.

**What We Track:**
- Suggestions sent to developers
- Suggestions that get implemented
- The percentage of suggestions that are adopted

**How It's Calculated:**
```
Implementation Rate = (Implemented Suggestions) รท (Total Suggestions Sent) ร 100
```

For example, if Kody sent 20 suggestions and 16 were implemented, your implementation rate is 80%.

## Why It Matters

Kody Suggestions provide several benefits for your development team:

- **Productivity Boost**: AI can catch common issues and suggest improvements
- **Code Quality**: Consistent suggestions help maintain coding standards
- **Learning Opportunity**: Developers learn best practices through AI feedback
- **Time Savings**: Reduce time spent on routine code review tasks

## How to Improve

- Configure custom Kody rules specific to your team's standards
- Provide feedback on suggestions to improve accuracy
- Ensure Kody has access to relevant codebase context
- Educate developers on how to use Kody effectively
- Share examples of how Kody has helped the team
- Gather input on suggestion usefulness
