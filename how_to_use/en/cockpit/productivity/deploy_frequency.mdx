## How We Calculate It

We count all PRs merged into the main branch within a specified period and divide by the selected time interval (by default, this is per week).

## Why It Matters

Frequent deployments ensure new features and bug fixes reach users quickly, boosting customer satisfaction and competitiveness. They also reduce risks and facilitate issue resolution.
