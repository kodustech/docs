## Quick Overview

- **Auto-tracking**: Automatically captures unimplemented suggestions from closed PRs
- **Smart resolution**: Auto-resolves when suggestions are implemented in future PRs
- **Advanced filtering**: Save custom views by status, severity, and category
- **Zero setup**: Works automatically with your existing code review workflow

## What It Is

The **Kody Issues** feature automatically tracks all suggestions generated by Kody that were **not implemented** in your pull requests (PRs). It acts like a sonar, providing a live list of pending improvements to ensure you never lose sight of critical feedback.

## How It Works

### 1. Issue Creation

<Note>
  Issues are only created when PRs are **closed** - not when they're opened or
  during review.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Kody rules of type **PR** do not generate issues. Only file-level and code-specific suggestions create trackable issues.
</Warning>

- When a PR is **closed**, Kody compiles all suggestions made in that PR that were **not applied**
- For each unimplemented suggestion, Kody automatically creates an **Issue** linked to the repository
- Each issue includes the original suggestion context, file location, and severity level

### 2. Automatic Resolution

- If a developer implements the suggested change in a **subsequent PR**, Kody marks the associated Issue as **Resolved**
- Kody intelligently matches implemented changes to existing issues using code analysis
- Resolution happens automatically without manual intervention

### 3. Manual Management

#### Status Control

- **Open**: New issues requiring attention
- **Resolved**: Automatically marked when suggestions are implemented
- **Dismissed**: Manually marked when suggestions aren't relevant to your team

#### Severity Adjustment

- Each Issue has a severity level (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`)
- You can update severity levels at any time to reflect your team's priorities
- Use severity to focus on the most impactful improvements first

### 4. Advanced Filtering

<Warning>
  Filters are powerful tools - save custom views to quickly access issues that
  matter most to your workflow.
</Warning>

- **Status filters**: Open, Resolved, Dismissed
- **Severity filters**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Category filters**: Security, Performance, Code Style, etc.
- **Repository filters**: Focus on specific projects
- **Save custom views**: Automatically apply your preferred filters

## Why It Matters

### For Development Teams

- **Never lose track** of important code improvements
- **Prioritize work** based on actual impact and severity
- **Learn patterns** from commonly dismissed vs. implemented suggestions

### For Engineering Managers

- **Track code quality** trends across repositories
- **Identify bottlenecks** in suggestion implementation
- **Measure improvement** in code review follow-through
