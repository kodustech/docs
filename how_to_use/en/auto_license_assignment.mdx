title: "Auto License Assignment"
---

The Auto License Assignment feature simplifies the management of developer licenses within your organization. Instead of manually assigning licenses to each developer, Kodus can automatically assign a license to active contributors.

## How it Works

When enabled, Kodus monitors pull request activity in your repositories.

-   **Automatic Assignment:** If a user creates more than one pull request, Kodus checks if there are available license slots in your organization.
    -   If a slot is available, the user is automatically assigned a license and their PRs will be reviewed.
    -   If no slots are available, Kodus will react to the pull request with a thumbs down emoji (👎) to indicate that the review could not be performed due to a lack of licenses.

## Ignored Users

You can configure a list of **Ignored Users**. These users will be excluded from the auto-assignment process.

-   **No Reviews:** Pull requests created by ignored users will not be reviewed by Kodus.
-   **No Reactions:** Kodus will not react to their PRs, even if they exceed the PR limit. It will be as if Kodus ignored the PR entirely.

This is useful for bots, service accounts, or specific team members who do not require code reviews.

## Configuration

To enable and configure Auto License Assignment:

1. Go to your **Code Review Settings**.
2. Navigate to the **Subscription** tab.
3. Locate the **Auto-assign licenses** section.
    - Use the toggle to enable or disable the feature.
    - If enabled, you can select users to add to the **Ignored Users** list.
