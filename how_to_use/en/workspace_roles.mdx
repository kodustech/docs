<Note>
**Workspace Members vs. PR Licenses**: These are separate concepts. You can have 1 workspace member but 20 PR licenses, or vice versa. Workspace members control administrative access to the workspace, while PR licenses determine how many pull requests can be reviewed per month.

## Overview

Kodus workspaces supports **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, allowing you to manage user permissions and access levels within your organization. Each workspace member can be assigned one of four distinct roles, each with specific permissions and capabilities.

## Available Roles

Each role provides different levels of access and capabilities within the workspace:

### Owner

**Full administrative access** to the workspace and all its resources. Can view, edit, and delete all configurations across all repositories.



### Billing Manager

**Financial and billing management** access with access to billing/subscription management and view access to most configurations, but no edit access to code review settings.

### Repository Admin

**Repository management** access focused on managing code review configurations for repositories they own, with full access to issues, cockpit, and plugins.

### Contributor

**Basic access** for team members who need to view configurations for repositories they are assigned to. Limited to view-only access for most features.

## Role Permissions Matrix

Here's a detailed breakdown of what each role can do, based on the actual permissions matrix:

**Legend**: V = View, E = Edit, D = Delete, (all) = All repositories, (own) = Own repositories only, - = No access

## Managing Workspace Members

### Adding New Members

1. Navigate to your workspace **Members** section
2. Click **"Invite member"** button
3. Enter the member's email address
4. Select the appropriate role for the new member
5. Send the invitation

### Changing Member Roles

1. Go to the **Members** section in your workspace
2. Find the member whose role you want to change
3. Click on their current role dropdown
4. Select the new role from the available options
5. The change takes effect immediately

### Removing Members

1. In the **Members** section, locate the member to remove
2. Click the **"Actions"** menu (three dots)
3. Select **"Remove from workspace"**
4. Confirm the removal in the dialog

## Security Considerations

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Always assign the role with the minimum necessary permissions
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review member roles and adjust as needed
3. **Access Reviews**: Conduct quarterly reviews of workspace access and permissions
4. **Immediate Revocation**: Remove access immediately when a member leaves the organization
