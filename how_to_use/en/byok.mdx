## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access BYOK Settings">
    Navigate to your organization settings at [app.kodus.io/organization/byok](https://app.kodus.io/organization/byok)

  <Step title="Configure Primary Model">
    Select your main provider (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, etc.) and enter your API key with your preferred model
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Fallback Model (Recommended)">
    Set up a secondary model as backup. If your primary model has issues or becomes unavailable, reviews automatically switch to the fallback
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Configuration">
    Kodus will validate both API keys and model selections before saving
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Important:** Always configure a fallback model to ensure continuous code reviews even if your primary provider experiences downtime or rate limits.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid API Key Error">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify the API key is correctly copied without extra spaces
    - Check that billing is enabled on your provider account
    - Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions
    - Try generating a new API key if the issue persists
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model Not Found Error">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify the model name matches your provider's exact format
    - Check if the model is available in your region
    - Ensure your account has access to the specified model
    - Try a different model to test if the issue is model-specific
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Issues">
    **Solutions:**
    - Check your provider's rate limits and upgrade if needed
    - Consider switching to a provider with higher rate limits
    - Contact your provider support to increase limits
    - Distribute usage across multiple API keys if allowed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom URL Connection Problems">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify the base URL format includes the protocol (https://)
    - Check that the endpoint supports OpenAI-compatible API
    - Test the URL directly with a tool like curl or Postman
    - Ensure there are no firewall restrictions blocking the connection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Unexpected Costs">
    **Solutions:**
    - Review your usage in the provider dashboard

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I switch providers anytime?">
    Yes. Changes take effect immediately for new reviews.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my API key runs out of credits?">
    Reviews automatically switch to your fallback model (if configured). Without a fallback, reviews fail until you add credits. Always configure a fallback model.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does the primary/fallback system work?">
    Primary handles all reviews by default. If it fails (rate limits, downtime, errors), Kodus switches to fallback automatically. You only pay for the model that processes each review.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I use the same provider for primary and fallback?">
    No. Use different providers (e.g., Google primary, OpenAI fallback) to protect against provider-specific outages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does BYOK compare to Managed mode?">
    **BYOK ($10/dev/month):** You manage API keys, full control, requires setup
    
    **Managed ($30/dev/month):** We handle everything, fixed costs, zero config
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you store our API keys securely?">
    Yes. Keys are encrypted at rest and in transit. We never log or store keys in plain text.
  </Accordion>
