The Kodus CLI reviews your code changes directly from the terminal — catching bugs, security issues, and style violations before they reach a pull request.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Skill Installer (Recommended)">
        Installs the CLI and deploys the review skill to all detected AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf):

        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://review-skill.com/install | bash
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install -g @kodus/cli
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="npx (No Install)">
        ```bash
        npx @kodus/cli review
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="curl">
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kodustech/cli/main/install.sh | bash
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Note>Requires Node.js >= 18.0.0.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    You can start without an account — just run `kodus review`. For full access, pick one:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Personal Login">
        ```bash
        kodus auth login
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Team Key (Recommended for Teams)">
        No individual signup needed. Generate a key at <a href="https://app.kodus.io/organization/cli-keys" target="_blank">app.kodus.io/organization/cli-keys</a> and click **Generate Key**.

        You'll get the key and a ready-to-share command to distribute to your team:

        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://review-skill.com/install | bash -s -- --team-key kodus_xxxxx
        ```

        Or configure it manually:

        ```bash
        kodus auth team-key --key kodus_xxxxx
        ```

        <Warning>Save the key when it's shown — it won't be displayed again.</Warning>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Info>
      **Self-hosted?** Point the CLI to your own API:
      ```bash
      export KODUS_API_URL=https://kodus-api.yourcompany.com
      ```
      HTTPS required (except localhost).
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Your First Review">
    ```bash
    kodus review
    ```

    That's it. The CLI will analyze your working tree changes and show issues interactively. You can also:

    ```bash
    kodus review --staged       # Only staged files
    kodus review --branch main  # Compare against a branch
    kodus review --fix          # Auto-apply all fixes
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
