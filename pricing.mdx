Hereâ€™s everything you need to know about our pricing to help you make the best decision for your organization.

## How Pricing Works

Our pricing is per developer who actively creates pull requests in your team. 
This ensures flexibility and scalability as your team evolves:
* **Pay Per Active Developer:** Only pay for developers who are actively contributing with pull requests.
* **Adjustable at Any Time:** Update the number of active developers anytime through your account settings.

## Pricing Tiers

We offer both monthly and annual billing options:

* **Monthly Plan:** $ 12 per developer per month.
* **Annual Plan:** $9 per developer per month (billed annually).
* **Special Discount:** Teams based in Brazil receive additional discounts.

## Unlimited Pull Requests

Your team can submit as many pull requests as they want each weekâ€”thereâ€™s no limit on PRs. The only restriction comes from the API limits of your Git provider.

## Support for Non-Profits and Open Source

We believe in supporting impactful work. Kodus is completely free for non-profit organizations and open-source projects. Contact us to apply for this program.

## Payments and Billing

* **Powered by Stripe:** Payments are processed securely using Stripe, a globally trusted platform.
* **Cancel Anytime:** You can cancel your plan at any point. Changes will take effect at the end of your billing cycle (monthly or annual).
* **Invoices and Brazilian Nota Fiscal:** For Brazilian customers ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, we provide invoices and issue a Nota Fiscal (tax receipt) for every transaction.

## Why Choose Kodus?

* **Fair and Transparent:** You only pay for active developers, ensuring that pricing scales with your needs.
