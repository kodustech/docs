## Introduction to the PAT

To enable Kody to perform automatic Code Reviews, you need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitLab. This token allows Kody to securely access your repositories and conduct code analysis in a controlled way.

## Generating the PAT (Personal Access Token)

Follow these steps to set up the token correctly:

1. **Access GitLab and go to your profile settings**:

   - [Click here to access the profile settings page](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens).

2. **Navigate to `Access Tokens`**:

   - In the left sidebar, scroll to find `Access Tokens` and click on it.

3. **Add a new token**:

   - Click on the `Add new token` button.

4. **Set up the new token with the following specifications**:

   - **Token Name**: Choose an easily identifiable name, such as `kody_code_review`.
   - **Expiration Date**: If possible, select a long expiration date, preferably at least 180 days.
   - **Permissions**: Set the following permissions:
     - **api**: Read access.
     - **read_api**: Read access.
     - **read_user**: Read access.
     - **read_repository**: Read access.
     - **write_repository**: Read access.

5. **Finalize and save the token**:
   - After configuring the permissions, click `Generate token`.
   - Make sure to copy the generated token and store it securely, as youâ€™ll need it to configure Kody.

## Adding the Token to Kody

After generating the token, paste it into the Kody automation setup screen. The configuration modal will open automatically when you attempt to enable the automation.
