## Introduction to the PAT

To enable Kody to perform automatic Code Reviews, you need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in Bitbucket. This token allows Kody to securely access your repositories and conduct code analysis in a controlled way.

## Generating the PAT (Personal Access Token)

You can access the App Passwords settings directly using this link: [Bitbucket App Passwords](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/).

Follow these steps to set up the token correctly:

1. **Access Bitbucket and go to your profile settings:**

   - Click on the gear icon in the top-right corner.

   - Select Personal Bitbucket settings.

2. **Navigate to App Passwords:**

   - In the left sidebar, scroll to find App Passwords and click on it.

3. **Add a new token:**

   - Click on the Create app password button.

- Set up the new token with the following specifications:

   - **Account:** Read permissions

   - **Workspace membership:** Read permissions

   - **Projects:** Read permissions

   - **Repositories:** Read, Write and Admin permissions

   - **Pull requests:** Read and Write permissions

   - **Issues:** Read permissions

   - **Webhooks:** Read and Write permissions

   - **Pipelines:** Read permissions

4. **Assign a label to the password:**

   - Choose an easily identifiable name, such as kody_code_review.

4. **Click Create.**

Copy the generated token and store it securely, as youâ€™ll need it to configure Kody.

<Note>
  Admin permission for Repositories is needed to add webhooks and listen to pull requests.
</Note>

## Adding the Token to Kody

After generating the token, paste it into the Kody automation setup screen. The configuration modal will open automatically when you attempt to enable the automation.
