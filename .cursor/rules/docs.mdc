# Documentation Writing Rules

## Core Principles

- **Clarity above all**: Documentation must be extremely easy to understand
- **No fluff**: Only include content that provides real value to users reading it
- **English only**: Simple, natural English as written by a native speaker
- **Consistent pattern**: Always follow the same structure as other docs, don't invent new components

## Writing Guidelines

- Avoid code comments unless absolutely necessary. If needed, write comments in English only
- Keep explanations concise and direct
- Use existing components from mintlify
- Focus on practical, actionable information
- Remove redundant explanations and obvious statements
- Maintain consistent tone across all documentation
