## How Groq works

Groq Cloud provides fast LLM inference with OpenAI-compatible APIs. Built for speed and simplicity, Groq offers ultra-fast inference for popular models like Llama, Deepseek, and more. The platform is designed to be simple to integrate and easy to scale, making it perfect for production applications.

## Recommended Models

We recommend good coding models with high context windows and fast inference.

<Info>
  For the most updated information, please visit [Groq's models page](https://console.groq.com/docs/models).

| Model                              | Context Window | Speed     |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| **Llama 3.3 70B Versatile** `recommended` | ~128k tokens   | Ultra Fast |
| **Deepseek R1 Distill Llama 70B** | ~128k tokens   | Ultra Fast |
| **Llama 3.1 70B Versatile**       | ~128k tokens   | Ultra Fast |

### Configure Groq in Environment File

Edit your `.env` file and configure the core settings. For **LLM Integration**, use Groq in Fixed Mode:

```env
# Core System Settings (update with your domains)
WEB_HOSTNAME_API="kodus-api.yourdomain.com"    
WEB_PORT_API=443                               
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://kodus-web.yourdomain.com"

# Security Keys (generate with openssl commands above)
WEB_NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-generated-secret"
WEB_JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-generated-secret"
API_CRYPTO_KEY="your-generated-hex-key"
API_JWT_SECRET="your-generated-secret"
API_JWT_REFRESHSECRET="your-generated-secret"

# Database Configuration
API_PG_DB_PASSWORD="your-secure-db-password"
API_MG_DB_PASSWORD="your-secure-db-password"

# Groq Configuration (Fixed Mode) 
API_LLM_PROVIDER_MODEL="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"             # Choose your preferred model
API_OPENAI_FORCE_BASE_URL="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"   # Groq API URL
API_OPEN_AI_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"                      # Your Groq API Key

# Git Provider Webhooks (choose your provider)
API_GITHUB_CODE_MANAGEMENT_WEBHOOK="https://kodus-api.yourdomain.com/github/webhook"
# or API_GITLAB_CODE_MANAGEMENT_WEBHOOK="https://kodus-api.yourdomain.com/gitlab/webhook"
# or GLOBAL_BITBUCKET_CODE_MANAGEMENT_WEBHOOK="https://kodus-api.yourdomain.com/bitbucket/webhook"
```

<Info>
  **Fixed Mode is ideal for Groq** because it provides OpenAI-compatible APIs with ultra-fast inference. This gives you the best performance with simple configuration.

### Set Up Reverse Proxy (For Production)

For webhooks and external access, configure Nginx:

```nginx
# Web App (port 3000)
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name kodus-web.yourdomain.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

# API (port 3001)  
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name kodus-api.yourdomain.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Verify Groq Integration

In addition to the basic installation verification, confirm that Groq is working:

```bash
# Verify Groq API connection specifically
docker logs kodus-orchestrator-prod | grep -i groq
```

<Tip>
  For detailed information about SSL setup, monitoring, and advanced configurations, see our [complete deployment guide](https://docs.kodus.io/docs/how_to_deploy/en/deploy_kodus/generic_vm).
