## How Kodus Docs MCP works

The Kodus Docs MCP exposes the entire public documentation set to Kody through the Model Context Protocol. Once the plugin is connected, any question you ask inside a pull request gains instant access to the latest docs—no manual copy/paste or links required.

## Prerequisites

- A Kodus workspace with access to the Plugins (beta) catalog.
- Permission to install workspace plugins.

## Install the MCP

1. Open the Plugins catalog in your workspace and choose **Add Custom Plugin**.
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Plugin Name**: `Kodus Docs MCP` (or any label your team prefers).
   - **URL**: `https://docs.kodus.io/mcp`.
   - Leave **Description**, **Logo URL**, **Protocol**, **Authorization**, and **Custom Headers** at their defaults—no extra configuration is required.
3. Click **Create Plugin**. The plugin becomes available immediately for everyone in the workspace.

## Use it with Kody

Mention Kody in a pull request comment or suggestion, then ask your question. Kody automatically queries the docs MCP to ground the answer.

**Example**

```
@kody, this PR introduces a new webhook. Can you check our docs and tell me which authentication headers it must include?
```

Need clarification? Just ask another follow-up—Kody already has the docs context loaded through the plugin.
