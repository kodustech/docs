title: "What are AI Workflows"
---

AI Workflows are automated processes that operate behind the scenes to assist teams in achieving their goals efficiently. By leveraging AI agents within the tools your team already uses, these workflows provide seamless support without disrupting your daily work.

## How AI Workflows Work

Each AI Workflow is designed to be triggered by specific events or conditions within your development and project management tools. Once triggered, the workflow activates the relevant agent, performs its task, and delivers the results directly in the tool your team is already using.

### Workflow Process

1. **Trigger Event**: Workflows begin based on pre-set events, such as a pull request being opened, the start of a daily check-in, or the end of a sprint.
2. **Agent Activation**: The relevant AI agent (e.g., CodeReviewer, TeamCoach) is automatically activated to handle the assigned task.
3. **Task Execution**: The agent carries out the workflow task—whether it’s a code review, performance summary, or documentation update—entirely in the background.
4. **Results Delivery**: The workflow’s output is delivered to your team within the tool you’re already using, ensuring minimal disruption and quick access to insights.

## Examples of AI Workflows

These examples illustrate how AI Workflows assist teams automatically, providing the right support exactly when it’s needed:

- **Automated Code Review Workflow**

  - **Trigger**: A pull request is created in the repository.
  - **Agent**: CodeReviewer
  - **Action**: Automatically reviews the code, highlights issues, and delivers feedback directly in the pull request thread.

- **Daily Check-In Workflow**

  - **Trigger**: Runs on user-configured days and times before the daily stand-up.
  - **Agent**: TeamCoach
  - **Action**: Provides a quick update on team progress, highlights blockers, and shares key metrics in the team’s communication tool.

- **Weekly Check-In Workflow**
  - **Trigger**: Runs every Friday or on the day selected by the user.
  - **Agent**: TeamCoach
  - **Action**: Summarizes weekly progress, completed tasks, outstanding items, and shares insights to help with planning for the upcoming week.

## Benefits of AI Workflows

1. **Hands-Free Support**: Workflows run quietly in the background, so your team can focus on high-impact work without manually managing routine tasks.
2. **Seamless Integration**: Information is shared directly within the tools your team already uses, ensuring quick access to updates and insights.
3. **Consistent Monitoring**: Key tasks and updates are handled automatically, providing peace of mind that nothing important is overlooked.
4. **Increased Productivity**: By automating routine work, AI Workflows help reduce manual effort and keep the team on track.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Can workflows be triggered manually?**

  - AI Workflows are designed to run automatically, but you can manually interact with agents if needed for specific tasks.

- **Are workflows secure?**

  - Yes, workflows operate within the permissions you’ve set, ensuring secure access to data and compliance with privacy settings.

- **What if a workflow isn’t needed anymore?**
  - You can disable workflows or adjust triggers and agents to better suit your evolving team needs.

AI Workflows provide continuous, behind-the-scenes support, freeing your team to focus on what matters most. Explore the available workflows and experience the benefits of automated, seamless assistance in your daily work.
