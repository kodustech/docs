Having trouble with Kody's code review feature? This guide will help you quickly identify and resolve common issues.

## Kody Code Review Not Working? Here's What to Do

### Token Issues

If you're connected via a token, you might encounter some common issues:

- **GitHub Users**: Ensure your token is enabled for your organization, not just your user settings. [Check permissions](https://localhost:3000/general_config/github_pat#check-fine-grained-access-permissions).
- **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Verify it's set for your organization and has the necessary permissions. [Manage tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
- **Token Expiry**: Confirm your token is active. [Check token status](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).

Your token should look like this, with your organization's photo. If your personal photo appears, it means your token is set to personal access.

### Configuration Issues

- **Automated Reviews**: Ensure they're enabled in [your settings](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general). Otherwise, start reviews manually with `@kody start-review`.
- **Review Types**: Select at least one type for Kody to suggest. [Configure here](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general).
- **Branch Reviews**: By default, Kody reviews PRs merged into the default branch. To include other branches, [configure here](https://app.kodus.io/automations/AutomationCodeReview/global/general).
- **Large PRs**: Note that PRs with many changes may take longer to process.
