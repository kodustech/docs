title: "Path Instructions"

Path-specific instructions allow you to set additional, file-specific code review conditions based on file paths. These guide Kody’s code review automation to apply specific guidelines only where they’re most relevant.

**Examples**:

- **Special Rules for Certain Files or Directories**:

  - Projects often contain files or folders that require particular attention due to sensitivity or complexity, such as configuration files, deployment scripts, or security-related code.
  - **Example**: For files in `config/`, ensure they follow strict security checks to prevent hardcoded sensitive information.

- **Code Review Customization**:

  - Tailor review practices for different code areas, ensuring specific guidelines are followed in relevant sections.
  - **Example**: In the `api/` directory, emphasize input validation and error handling.

- **Enhancing Code Quality**:
  - **Example**: In UI-related files, focus on accessibility and responsiveness best practices.
