Kody's PR Summary feature allows you to automate the creation of concise, actionable pull request descriptions.
This configuration guide explains how to tailor the feature to suit your team’s workflow and preferences.

## Enabling Automatic Summaries

Enable or disable the automatic generation of pull request summaries:

Toggle the Enable Automatic Summary Generation option.

When enabled, Kody will generate summaries for every pull request, ensuring consistency and saving time.

## Behavior for Existing Descriptions

Control how Kody interacts with existing pull request descriptions. You can choose from three modes:

### Replace (Default):

Overwrites any existing description with a newly generated summary from scratch.

### Concatenate:

Appends the generated summary to the end of the existing description.

### Complement:

Combines Kody’s generated insights with the current description, highlighting only what’s new or relevant.

## Custom Instructions

Fine-tune how Kody generates summaries by providing specific guidelines:

Add instructions directly in the Custom Instructions text field.

**Examples:**

* "Focus on security changes and performance impacts."
* "Summarize concisely, highlighting modified public APIs."
