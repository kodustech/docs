## How It Works

Whenever a team member opens a pull request, Kody performs a Code Review directly in your code management tool, such as GitHub or GitLab. Kody analyzes the code, provides detailed feedback, and highlights potential issues, just as a human reviewer would. This ensures code quality and speeds up the review process.

Additionally, you can use the command `@kody start-review` directly in Git to have Kody initiate a code review on any pull request. This command bypasses branch and naming configurations, so Kody will review any PR where the command is used.
